Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 1 --- PAGE 4 END --- Item 1. Business Part I ITEM 1. BUSINESS General As a global airline based in the United States, we connect customers across our expansive global network with a commitment to ensuring that the future of travel is connected, personalized and enjoyable. In 2024, we served over 200 million customers safely, reliably and with industry-leading customer service innovation. Competitive Advantages and Brand Strength In 2024, we continued to differentiate Delta from the industry and to invest in the durability of our competitive advantages. These enduring competitive advantages that support our trusted consumer brand include our people and culture, operational reliability, global network, customer loyalty and financial foundation. People and Culture The Delta people and culture are our strongest competitive advantage. Our more than 100,000 employees provide world-class travel experiences for our customers and best-in-class service. We believe that Delta's brand transcends the industry, powered by our people's outstanding work and passion for serving our customers. In 2024, Delta was recognized as the world's No. 11 Most Admired Company as ranked by FORTUNE, and was ranked No. 13 in the U.S. on Glassdoor's Best Places to Work list. Our industry-leading profit sharing program directly aligns our employees' interests with the company's long-term success and for 2024, we are rewarding them with $1.4 billion in profit sharing payments. The company also maintains a Shared Rewards program to incentivize operational performance, and our employees earned $86 million under this program in 2024. Operational Reliability We remain committed to industry-leading reliability as the foundation for our brand promise and efficiency. We are consistently among the industry's best performers, delivering the best on-time arrival and completion factor among our network carrier peers in 2024. In recognition of our unwavering commitment to operational performance, we were honored for the fourth consecutive year with the Cirium Platinum Award for global operational excellence in January 2025 and named the most on-time airline in North America. The Wall Street Journal named us the top airline of 2024 among the nine major U.S. airlines in its annual airline scorecard for the fourth consecutive year, leading the industry in on-time arrivals and fewest involuntary denied boardings. Global Network We and our alliance partners collectively serve over 120 countries and territories and over 800 destinations around the world. At the end of 2024, we offered up to 5,000 peak-day flights to more than 290 destinations on six continents. Our domestic network is centered around core hubs in Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Salt Lake City. Core hubs have strong local passenger share, a high penetration of customers loyal to Delta, a competitive cost position and strong margins. Core hub positions complement coastal hub positions in Boston, Los Angeles, New York-LaGuardia, New York-JFK and Seattle. Coastal hubs provide a strong presence in large revenue markets and enable growth in premium products and international service. In 2024, we focused on increasing flights at our core hubs while improving the efficiency of our operations in our coastal hubs. We",600

Core hub positions complement coastal hub positions in Boston, Los Angeles, New York-LaGuardia, New York-JFK and Seattle. Coastal hubs provide a strong presence in large revenue markets and enable growth in premium products and international service. In 2024, we focused on increasing flights at our core hubs while improving the efficiency of our operations in our coastal hubs. We continue to leverage our coastal gateways and strategic relationships with international airline partners to further expand our international service. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 2 --- PAGE 5 END --- Item 1. Business Internationally, we seek to bring more choice to customers through innovative alliances with Aeroméxico, Air France-KLM, China Eastern, LATAM Airlines Group S.A. (""LATAM""), Korean Air and Virgin Atlantic. We operate significant hubs in, or have market presence in the key cities of, Amsterdam, Bogota, Lima, London-Heathrow, Mexico City, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Santiago (Chile), Sao Paulo, Seoul-Incheon and Tokyo. Our strategic relationships with international airlines are an important part of our business as they improve our access to markets around the world and enable us to provide customers a more seamless global travel experience across our alliance network. The most significant of these arrangements are commercial joint ventures or cooperation agreements that include joint sales and marketing coordination, co-location of airport facilities and other commercial cooperation arrangements. In some cases, we have reinforced strategic alliances through equity investments where we have the opportunity to create deep relationships and maximize commercial cooperation. Our global network is supported by a fleet of 1,292 aircraft as of December 31, 2024 that are varied in size and capabilities, giving us flexibility to adjust aircraft to the network. We are continuing to refresh our fleet by acquiring new and more fuel-efficient aircraft with increased premium seating and cargo capacity to replace retiring aircraft, while modifying our existing aircraft cabins to increase premium offerings and harmonize interiors. Simultaneously, we continue on our multi-year journey of fleet simplification by replacing retiring aircraft with deliveries of next-generation aircraft. In 2024, we took delivery of 38 aircraft, including A321neos, A220-300s, A330-900s and A350-900 aircraft. Customer Loyalty With operational excellence, best-in-class service and commitment to our customers, we have continued to earn our customers' trust and preference by delivering the ""Delta Difference."" We continue to invest in elevated customer experiences through generational airport investments, including new Delta One Lounges and Delta Sky Clubs in key markets, and innovative technology initiatives such as Delta Sync to deliver seamless, personalized experiences at scale. We believe our continued investment in customer service and experience, operations, product, airports and technology has shaped customer perception of our brand leading to improvements in our domestic net promoter scores and increased customer loyalty. In 2024, various outlets recognized Delta as a trusted consumer brand, including: + Recognized as the 2024 Airline of the Year by aviation publication Air Transport World. + Named Best U.S. Airline and topped five categories in the Forbes Travel Guide's Luxury Air Travel Awards. * Named the number one airline by corporate travel customers in the annual Business Travel News Airline Survey for the 14"" year in a row and the number one U.S. airline by Condé Nast Traveler readers. + Earned the number one spot on The Points Guy's list of best U.S. Airlines for the sixth year in a row.

Our award-winning SkyMiles program, discussed in further detail below, is designed to attract lifetime members and to grow customer loyalty by offering our customers a wide variety of benefits when traveling with us and our partners, and personalizing our engagement with them. We aim to increase the value of our program and to deepen customer engagement with Delta through a growing ecosystem of partnerships with premier brands and travel- adjacent experiences, extending the value of our SkyMiles currency beyond flight. We expect the increased value we provide customers to deliver high- margin revenue and resilient cash flows. Financial Foundation Over the past 15 years of consistent strategy, investment and execution, we have fundamentally transformed our business by investing in our people, our product and our reliability to alter the commodity-like nature of air travel and improve our financial foundation. We strive to continue achieving differentiated performance by delivering sustained value creation through margin expansion, durable earnings and free cash flow, and balance sheet strength. Restoring the strength of our balance sheet and reducing debt remains a key financial priority. During 2024, we made approximately $4.0 billion in payments on debt and finance lease obligations. Recognizing our continued progression on debt reduction and improving financial results, we regained our investment grade rating from all three major rating agencies, marking a key financial milestone for Delta. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 3 --- PAGE 6 END --- Item 1. Business We have diversified our business by growing high-margin revenue streams that leverage our competitive advantages, including: * Our continued focus on our premium products (including Delta One®, First Class, Delta Premium Select and Delta Comfort+®) and customer segmentation, which has reduced our reliance on the most price sensitive customer segment. + Our partnership with American Express, which provides us a co-brand revenue stream tied to broader consumer spending. * Our Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (""MRO"") operation, where we are well-positioned for growth through contractual agreements with jet engine manufacturers, including three next-generation engine platforms. * Our other complementary portfolio businesses, such as our cargo operations and Delta Vacations. Our premium yield growth has significantly outpaced main cabin, with record paid load factors in premium cabin in 2024, as demand for premium products continues to grow. In 2024, we introduced aircraft with more premium seating and completed cabin modification programs to increase premium offerings. SkyMiles Program Our SkyMiles program provides members with the ability to earn mileage credits (""miles"") when traveling on Delta, Delta Connection and our partner airlines. Miles may also be earned by using certain services offered by program partners, such as credit card, retail, ridesharing, car rental and hotel companies. To facilitate transactions with participating companies, we sell miles to non-airline businesses and other airlines.

In 2024, remuneration from American Express totaled $7.4 billion, which we expect to grow to $10 billion over the long-term. Innovative Investments in Technology Our objective is to make technology a strategic differentiator. We continue to invest in technological improvements that enhance the customer experience, support our operations and empower our people. These investments include innovations to customer facing applications and improvements to infrastructure and technology architecture to unify and improve access to data sources. We believe this digital transformation enhances interactions with our customers and allows our people to deliver more personalized service, further enhancing the customer experience, strengthening our brand and driving revenue and efficiency. Through the development of innovative new technologies, we provide our employees with greater tools to allow them to have more meaningful interactions with our customers and to serve them better. For our customers, we are making investments in the digital platforms on the ground and in the air. We continue to evolve the Fly Delta app into a digital travel concierge for our customers to offer convenient services on the day of travel and deliver thoughtful notifications to make their travel journeys more seamless. On the ground, we are investing to create a smoother and less stressful travel experience. Onboard the aircraft, we continue to invest in our in-flight entertainment and are expanding fast and free Wi-Fi for all customers through a free SkyMiles account, which is now on most domestic mainline flights with plans for full availability on international and regional aircraft. We also continue to innovate and enhance Delta Sync, which will enable the creation of more personalized experiences over the next several years. We continue to elevate the consumer experience across the travel journey and beyond, including through partnerships with leading brands, to broaden the Delta SkyMiles ecosystem and the range of benefits we provide to our members.

In addition to the joint venture, we own just under 15% of the outstanding common stock of Hanjin-KAL, the largest shareholder of Korean Air. Each of our joint venture or joint cooperation agreements described above has been approved and granted antitrust immunity from the U.S. Department of Transportation (""DOT""). The grant of antitrust immunity for our joint cooperation agreement with Aeroméxico is subject to a pending renewal application with the DOT, which was tentatively dismissed pursuant to an Order to Show Cause issued by the DOT on January 26, 2024. The existing immunity remains in effect pending final adjudication of the renewal application, the timing and outcome of which cannot be predicted at this time. Enhanced Commercial Agreements with China Eastern. We own a 2% equity interest in China Eastern, with whom we have a strategic joint marketing and commercial cooperation arrangement covering traffic flows between China and the U.S., which includes reciprocal codesharing, loyalty program participation, airport lounge access and joint sales cooperation. SkyTeam. We are a member of the SkyTeam global airline alliance. The other members of SkyTeam are Aerolineas Argentinas, Aeroméxico, Air Europa (Spain), Air France, China Airlines, China Eastern, Garuda Indonesia, ITA Airways (formerly Alitalia), Kenya Airways, KLM, Korean Air, Middle East Airlines, SAS Scandinavian Airlines, Saudia, TAROM (Romania), Vietnam Airlines, Virgin Atlantic and Xiamen Airlines (China).

Business Regional Carriers We have air service agreements with domestic regional air carriers that feed traffic to our network by serving passengers primarily in small and medium-sized cities in the domestic market. These arrangements enable us to better match capacity with demand in these markets. Through our regional carrier program, Delta Connection®, we have contractual arrangements with regional carriers to operate aircraft using our ""DL"" designator code. We currently have contractual arrangements with: + Endeavor Air, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ours (""Endeavor""). + Republic Airways, Inc. + SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (""SkyWest Airlines""). Our contractual agreements with regional carriers are primarily capacity purchase arrangements, under which we control the scheduling, pricing, reservations, ticketing and seat inventories for the regional carriers' flights operating under our ""DL"" designator code. We are entitled to all ticket, cargo, mail, in-flight and ancillary revenues associated with the flights under these capacity purchase arrangements. We pay those airlines an amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services. These capacity purchase agreements are long-term agreements, usually with initial terms of at least ten years, which grant us the option to extend the initial term. Certain of these agreements provide us the right to terminate the entire agreement, or in some cases remove some of the aircraft from the scope of the agreement, for convenience at certain future dates. SkyWest Airlines operates some flights for us under a revenue proration agreement. This proration agreement establishes a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries. Cargo Through our global network, our cargo operations are able to connect the world's major freight gateways. We generate cargo revenues in domestic and international markets through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft. We are a member of SkyTeam Cargo, an international airline cargo alliance with eight other airlines that offer a network spanning six continents, through which we provide global solutions to our customers by connecting our network with those partners. In 2024, cargo revenues were approximately $822 million. Other Complementary Businesses We have various other businesses arising from our airline operations, including the following: + In addition to providing maintenance and engineering support for our fleet of 1,292 mainline and regional aircraft, our MRO operation, known as Delta TechOps, serves aviation and airline customers from around the world.

Business Environmental Sustainability We are pursuing a long-term strategy to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from our airline operations by 2050, with initiatives focused around three key themes: What We Fly, How We Fly, and the Fuel We Use. Throughout 2024, we continued to prioritize innovative measures to reduce emissions and other environmental impacts across our business. What We Fly + Fleet renewal and optimization: We continue to make our existing fleet more efficient as older aircraft are retired. Additions to our fleet since 2019, including 38 aircraft delivered in 2024, are on average 28% more fuel efficient per seat mile than aircraft retired since 2019. In addition to accepting deliveries of next-generation fleet types, we have also invested in retrofitting our existing fleet with updated technologies that optimize and reduce fuel consumption. Following the installation of split-scimitar winglets on our Boeing 737-900ER fleet in 2021, we expect to complete similar modifications on the Boeing 737-800 fleet by the end of 2025, an enhancement expected to drive over three million gallons of fuel savings annually. Cumulatively, fleet renewal and optimization efforts have led to a 6.6% improvement in fleet-wide fuel efficiency since 2019. * Pursuing future aviation technologies: Our sustainability strategy aims to introduce revolutionary aircraft into our fleet. In 2024, we joined a collaborative project between Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Airbus and Plug Power to assess the feasibility of hydrogen fueling at the world's busiest airport. This innovative project supplements previously announced partnerships with Boeing and NASA on their Sustainable Flight Demonstrator program, also known as the X-66, as well as our investment in Joby Aviation, which aims to pioneer home-to-airport transportation through electric, vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) technology. How We Fly + Aircraft operations: We achieved fuel savings through initiatives like enhanced routing and landing procedures, reductions to catering service weight and use of new engine cleaning technologies. In 2024, these fuel efficiency efforts allowed us to save approximately 44 million gallons of jet fuel in comparison to fuel consumption in 2019, based on our projected fuel usage had we not undertaken these initiatives. ¢ — Plastic waste reduction: In late 2024, we began using a new paper cup on board international flights with plans to expand use across all domestic flights in the first half of 2025. Once fully implemented, the new paper cup will help eliminate nearly seven million pounds of single-use plastic on board annually. * Ground operations: We continue to work with airport partners to drive fuel savings by limiting the use of aircraft Auxiliary Power Units (""APUs"") during ground operations. In 2024, we installed 30 new preconditioned air units at our Detroit and Minneapolis hubs, which serve as electric alternatives to APUs and do not require jet fuel. The Fuel We Use * Continued investment in sustainable aviation fuel (""SAF""): With approximately 90% of our carbon emissions coming from jet fuel, finding lower emissions fuel alternatives is critical to making progress toward net zero.

The Fuel We Use * Continued investment in sustainable aviation fuel (""SAF""): With approximately 90% of our carbon emissions coming from jet fuel, finding lower emissions fuel alternatives is critical to making progress toward net zero. SAF, which can be channeled to airports through existing fuel infrastructure, is central to reducing the lifecycle emissions from aviation fuel and is safe to use in current aircraft engines. However, SAF is currently produced in small quantities that do not meet the industry's growing demand and remains significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel. Because SAF is not being produced at the scale needed, we continue to catalyze investment and stimulate SAF production by signing offtake agreements with various SAF producers. Under these agreements, we have contracted to purchase SAF when it is available, subject to certain conditions. In 2024, we used over 14 million gallons of SAF onboard our aircraft, a small fraction of our overall fuel consumption but more than four times our 2023 SAF utilization. * Building coalitions for the future: We are a founding member of the Minnesota SAF Hub, a first-of-its-kind partnership among corporations seeking to collaborate on scaling SAF production. Our work with the Minnesota SAF Hub reached a key milestone in 2024, announcing the development of the first SAF blending facility in Minnesota, a collaboration between Delta and Flint Hills Resources, which is expected to blend up to 30 million gallons of SAF annually once fully operational. We continue to advocate for policy incentives to scale the SAF market, including as a founding member of Americans for Clean Aviation Fuels, a diverse coalition of the largest industrial sectors in America from farmers to fuel producers and aviation to agribusiness. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 7 --- PAGE 10 END --- Item 1. Business The global aviation industry is viewed as a ""hard-to-abate"" sector, meaning it is innately difficult to decarbonize. Achieving our long-term goals will require substantial expansion of the SAF market, the adoption of new technologies, engagement from both internal and external stakeholders, as well as partnerships across industries to increase production of alternative fuels and help drive down costs. Fuel Our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. We purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices and therefore do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies. We also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market, from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price. We are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, including fuel produced by Monroe or procured through the exchange of gasoline, diesel and other refined petroleum products (""non-jet fuel products"") the refinery produces, and crude oil for Monroe's operations.

Monroe Energy Our Monroe subsidiaries operate the Trainer refinery and related logistics assets located near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The facilities include pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the Northeastern U.S., including our New York hubs at LaGuardia and JFK. These companies are distinct from us, operating under their own management teams and with their own boards. We own Monroe as part of our strategy to mitigate the cost of the refining margin reflected in the price of jet fuel, as well as to maintain sufficiency of supply to our New York operations. Refinery Operations. The facility is capable of refining approximately 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day and sources domestic and foreign crude oil supply from a variety of providers. Strategic Agreements. Monroe has agreements in place to exchange the non-jet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations. Environmental Sustainability. We are evaluating operational pathways for integrating Monroe into Delta's net zero future. Monroe's sustainability ambitions include being one of the most energy efficient refineries in the country with the lowest energy intensity and greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions on an absolute and per barrel basis. For example, Monroe continues the execution of its plan to replace steam-driven turbines that currently power pumps at the facility with more efficient and reliable electric motors, which will reduce the amount of steam required from the facility's natural gas-fired boilers. The Monroe team also provides their expertise on refining, biofuels, and the challenges of scaling SAF regularly to the Delta team. Fuel Hedging Program Our derivative contracts to hedge the financial risk from changing fuel prices are related to Monroe's inventory. We may utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and frequently test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets. We closely monitor the hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions, which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates.

The health and safety of our employees is foundational to achieving these objectives. Delta's Safety Management System is central to promoting a positive safety culture, proactively managing safety risk, and making investments to ensure a safe experience for our employees and customers. Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is critical to effective human capital management at Delta. Embedded in our business as a global airline is the belief that hiring the most qualified talent with diverse backgrounds and perspectives enables us to best serve our global customers, communities and each other. Our commitment to delivering experiences where all people feel seen, heard and valued continues — taking care of people in this way fosters innovation, talent retention, customer engagement and business growth. In our merit-based hiring and promotions, we seek highly qualified diverse talent internally and externally in an effort to achieve broader representation throughout our organization. In addition, we are reviewing and revising systems, practices and policies in support of our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, with a focus on achieving equitable outcomes for all employees in our merit-based human capital management. Three key areas on which we are focused are (1) reinforcing our diverse talent pipeline by, among other things, seeking expanded hiring candidate slates and interview panels to reflect diverse backgrounds and experiences, (2) expanding our internal and external career pathways and leadership development opportunities, in part, by introducing a skills-first talent approach, which creates merit-based access to career opportunities by considering skills as equivalencies to education, and (3) working to ensure our senior leadership team reflects the diversity of backgrounds and experiences of our 100,000 employees by adopting recruitment strategies that seek qualified leadership candidates with diverse experiences, skills and perspectives and expanding leadership development programs to continue promoting from within. We also believe that listening, engaging and connecting with employees furthers our human capital management objectives. We have historically done so primarily through our open-door policy, employee engagement groups and business resource groups, digital communication across all levels of the company, in-person events with senior management and company-wide and division-specific surveys to evaluate employee satisfaction. We leverage business insights, strengthen employee satisfaction and offer educational and development opportunities to employees through our four employee engagement groups and our twelve employee resource groups, which we refer to as business resource groups, totaling membership of more than 40,000 as of December 31, 2024.

This agreement is governed by the National Labor Relations Act (""NLRA""), which generally allows either party to engage in self-help upon the expiration of the agreement. Certain of our employees outside the U.S. are represented by unions, work councils or other local representative groups. Labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of our employees, including at our operating subsidiaries, that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes. Competition The airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, schedules (both timing and frequency), operational reliability, services, products, customer service and loyalty programs. The industry has evolved through mergers, new entries, both domestically and internationally, and changes in international alliances. Consolidation in the airline industry, the presence of subsidized government- sponsored international carriers, changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered, and will continue to alter, the competitive landscape in the industry, resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with significant financial resources, extensive global networks and competitive cost structures. Domestic Our domestic operations are subject to significant competition from traditional network carriers, including American Airlines and United Airlines, national point-to-point carriers, including Alaska Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines, and other discount or ultra-low-cost carriers, including Allegiant Air, Avelo Airlines, Breeze Airways, Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines. Some of these carriers have business models primarily focused on maintaining low costs, with the intention of providing service at lower fares to destinations served by Delta. In particular, we face significant competition at our domestic hubs and key airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity. We also face competition in small- to medium-sized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers.

International Our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers, including from point-to-point carriers on certain international routes. Through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to and beyond traditional European, Asian and Latin American gateway cities. Similarly, foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior U.S. passenger traffic beyond traditional U.S. gateway cities through these relationships. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 10 --- PAGE 13 END --- Item 1. Business In particular, several joint ventures among U.S. and foreign carriers, including several of our joint ventures as well as those of our competitors, have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate networks, schedules, pricing, sales and inventory. In addition, alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers, including SkyTeam, the Star Alliance (among United Airlines, Lufthansa German Airlines, Air Canada and others) and the oneworld alliance (among American Airlines, British Airways, Qantas and others) have enhanced competition in international markets. Regulatory Matters The DOT and the Federal Aviation Administration (the ""FAA"") exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the U.S. The DOT has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide air transportation. An air carrier that the DOT finds fit, willing and able to perform the proposed service is given authority to operate domestic and international air transportation (including the carriage of passengers and cargo), as applicable. Since the passage of the Airline Industry Deregulation Act in 1978, airlines have generally been free to launch or terminate service to U.S airports without restriction, except with respect to certain slot-controlled and schedule-facilitated airports, as well as certain constraints related to service to small communities governed by the ""Essential Air Services"" program. The DOT has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters, such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition, advertising, denied boarding compensation, baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation. The DOT also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between domestic and international carriers. The DOT engages in regulation of economic matters such as transactions involving allocation of ""slots"" or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at airports where such mechanisms are in place. The FAA has primary responsibility for matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations, including airline operating certificates, control of navigable air space, flight personnel, aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety. Authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the DOT and by the governments of the foreign countries involved. International certificate authorities are also subject to the approval of the U.S. President for conformity with national defense and oreign policy objectives. The Transportation Security Administration (""TSA"") and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, each a division of the Department of Homeland Security, are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters, including passenger and baggage screening at U.S. airports and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the U.S. Airlines are also",600

For example, the U.S. Department of Justice has jurisdiction over some airline competition matters. The U.S. Postal Service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail. Labor relations in the airline industry, as discussed below, are generally governed by the Railway Labor Act with oversight by the National Mediation Board (""NMB""). Environmental matters are regulated by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities. Privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations. Fares and Rates Airlines set ticket prices in all domestic and most international city-pairs with minimal governmental regulation, and the industry is characterized by significant price competition. Certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the DOT and the governments of the foreign countries involved. Many of our tickets are sold by travel agents, and fares are subject to commissions, overrides and discounts paid to travel agents, brokers and wholesalers. Route Authority Our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and also by exemptions and limited-entry frequency awards issued by the DOT. The requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements (and a multilateral agreement in the case of the U.S. and the European Union (""EU"")) with, or permits or approvals issued by, foreign countries. Because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the U.S. and the foreign country or countries involved, changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations. Bilateral agreements between the U.S. and various foreign countries that we serve are subject to renegotiation from time to time. The U.S. government has negotiated ""Open Skies"" agreements with many countries, which allow unrestricted access between the U.S. and these foreign markets. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 11 --- PAGE 14 END --- Item 1. Business Certain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements. We request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate.

In the U.S., the FAA currently regulates the allocation of slots, slot exemptions, operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at Reagan National in Washington, D.C. and LaGuardia and JFK in the New York City area. Our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorizations. Similarly, our operations at London's Heathrow airport and other international airports are regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the International Air Transport Association's Worldwide Scheduling Guidelines and applicable local law. We currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights, and we have generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to do so in the future because, among other reasons, such allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies. Airline Labor Regulation In the U.S., airlines and labor unions are governed by the Railway Labor Act. Under the Railway Labor Act, a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the NMB an application alleging a representation dispute, along with authorization cards signed by at least 50% of the employees in that craft or class. The NMB then investigates the dispute and, if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards, conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class. A labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class if more than 50% of votes cast are for representation. A certified labor union would then commence negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer. Under the Railway Labor Act, a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. Either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB may determine, at any time, that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration. If either party rejects binding arbitration, a 30-day ""cooling off"" period begins. At the end of this 30-day period, the parties may engage in ""self-help,"" unless the U.S. President appoints a Presidential Emergency Board (""""PEB"") to investigate and report on the dispute. The appointment of a PEB maintains the ""status quo"" for an additional 60 days. If the parties do not reach agreement during this period, the parties may then engage in self-help. Self-help includes, among other things, a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline. The U.S. Congress and the President have the authority to prevent self-help by enacting legislation that, among other things, imposes a settlement on the parties.

We are also subject to certain environmental laws and contractual obligations governing the management and release of regulated substances, which may require the investigation and remediation of affected sites. Soil and/or ground water impacts have been identified at certain of our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports. To address these impacts, we have a program in place to investigate and, if appropriate, remediate these sites. Although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 12 --- PAGE 15 END --- Item 1. Business In 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the ""EPA"") finalized regulations defining certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (""""PFAS"") as ""hazardous substances"" under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (""CERCLA""), and the EPA also finalized standards regulating PFAS under the Safe Drinking Water Act. PFAS are man-made chemicals that have been used in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products, including the firefighting foams used to extinguish fuel-based fires at airports and refineries. Numerous states have adopted regulations governing PFAS as well. The EPA's final rule under CERCLA, and analogous state laws could subject airports, airlines, and refineries, among others, to potential liability for cleanup of historical PFAS contamination associated with use of PFAS-containing firefighting foam. In addition, some states have adopted legislation prohibiting the manufacture, sale, distribution and/or use of firefighting foam containing intentionally added PFAS, which may require transition to alternative fire suppression systems. Delta has been developing plans to transition its aircraft maintenance hangars to systems that do not contain intentionally added PFAS. The ultimate impact and associated cost to Delta of these legislative and regulatory developments cannot be predicted at this time. GHG Enissions. Aviation industry GHG emissions, particularly carbon emissions, and their impact on climate change have become a focus in the international community and within the U.S. In 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (""ICAO"") formally adopted a global, market-based emissions offset program known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (""CORSIA""). This program establishes a goal for the aviation industry to achieve carbon-neutral growth in international aviation beginning in 2021. Any growth above the baseline would need to be addressed using either eligible carbon offsets or a lower carbon fuel. ICAO set the baseline for establishing airlines' obligations under CORSIA for 2021 to 2023 based on 2019 travel, and in 2022 set a new, more stringent CORSIA baseline of 85% of 2019, which will apply from 2024 through 2035. The pilot phase of the CORSIA program ran from 2021 through 2023, and is being followed by a first phase of the program beginning in 2024 anda second phase beginning in 2027. Countries can voluntarily participate in the pilot and first phase, and the United",600

ICAO set the baseline for establishing airlines' obligations under CORSIA for 2021 to 2023 based on 2019 travel, and in 2022 set a new, more stringent CORSIA baseline of 85% of 2019, which will apply from 2024 through 2035. The pilot phase of the CORSIA program ran from 2021 through 2023, and is being followed by a first phase of the program beginning in 2024 anda second phase beginning in 2027. Countries can voluntarily participate in the pilot and first phase, and the United States agreed to participate in these voluntary phases. Participation in the second phase is mandatory for certain countries, including the United States. The U.S. government has not yet enacted legislation to mandate that U.S. operators participate in CORSIA. Nonetheless, we have voluntarily submitted verified emissions reports on our annual international emissions. While airlines had no offsetting obligations during the pilot phase of CORSIA as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on international travel, we expect that international airline emissions will likely exceed the new baseline during the next phase (2024 — 2026). Because certain CORSIA program details remain to be developed and could potentially be affected by political developments in participating countries or the results of the initial phases of the program, the impact of CORSIA cannot be predicted at this time. However, CORSIA is expected to increase operating costs for airlines that operate internationally. Additionally, the EU requires its member states to implement regulations to include aviation in its Emissions Trading Scheme (""ETS""). Under these regulations, any airline with flights originating or landing in the European Economic Area (""EEA"") is subject to the ETS and, beginning in 2012, was required to purchase emissions allowances if the airline exceeds the number of free allowances allocated to it under the ETS. The initial scope of the ETS, however, was narrowed so that it would apply only to flights within the EEA through 2023 to align with the pilot phase of CORSIA. In 2023, the EU adopted new legislation extending this narrow scope of the EU ETS until 2027. It also requires a review of CORSIA's effectiveness in 2026, which could potentially lead to expansion of the EU ETS to include all flights departing the EU and EEA. As a result of the United Kingdom's (""UK"") withdrawal from the EU, UK flights are no longer part of the EU ETS and are instead regulated under a separate UK ETS scheme. UK ETS is applicable to UK domestic flights and flights from the UK to EEA countries. In 2017, ICAO also adopted aircraft certification standards to reduce carbon dioxide (""""CO,"") emissions from new aircraft. The new aircraft certification standards applied to new fleet types in 2020 and will apply to in-production aircraft no later than 2028. These standards will not apply to existing in-service aircraft. In 2021, the EPA finalized GHG emission standards for new aircraft engines designed to implement the ICAO standards on the same timeframe contemplated by ICAO, and these standards have been upheld in response to legal challenges. Like the ICAO standards, the final EPA standards do not apply to engines on in-service aircraft. The airline industry may face additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the U.S. and abroad and become subject to further taxes, charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for GHG emissions in various jurisdictions. For example, in 2023, the EU adopted legislation that imposes a SAF mandate on fuel supplied at EU airports. The mandate requires that,",600

For example, in 2023, the EU adopted legislation that imposes a SAF mandate on fuel supplied at EU airports. The mandate requires that, of the jet fuel supplied in the EU, 2% must be SAF beginning in 2025, and the percentage increases incrementally over time to 70% in 2050. This mandate is expected to increase the cost of SAF in the EU. In 2024, the UK also adopted legislation that imposes a SAF mandate on producers that supply fuel to UK airports, and other countries are also considering similar mandates. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 13 --- PAGE 16 END --- Item 1. Business Additional regulation could result in taxation, regulatory or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations and significant costs for us and the airline industry. In addition to direct costs, such regulation could result in increased fuel costs passed through from fuel suppliers affected by any such regulations. Certain airports have also adopted, and others could in the future adopt, GHG emission or climate-related goals and requirements that could impact our operations or require us to make changes or investments in our infrastructure. We are monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such developments. Noise. The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of U.S. airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system. This statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on Stage 3 aircraft first effective after October 1, 1990 require FAA approval. While we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past, our operations could be adversely impacted if locally imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread. In addition, foreign governments may enact or allow airports to enact similar restrictions, which could adversely impact our international operations or require significant expenditures in order for our aircraft to comply with the restrictions. For example, in 2022, to reduce noise, the Netherlands announced a multi-phase plan to reduce the maximum number of flights authorized annually at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport. In 2023, airlines and airline associations, including Delta and KLM, challenged the initial phase of the plan. The U.S., the European Commission and other governments also raised legal concerns about the plan with the Dutch government. In November 2023, the Netherlands suspended the initial phase of the plan, and in 2024, the Netherlands Supreme Court found that the Dutch government's flight reduction plan was unlawful. The Dutch government has issued a revised plan, which is under review with the European Commission. Neither the outcome of the review of the plan, nor the impact of its implementation, can be determined at this time. Refinery Matters.

Monroe's operation of the Trainer refinery is subject to numerous environmental laws and extensive regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas and other air emissions. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, as expanded by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the Renewable Fuel Standard (""RFS"") was created, setting up specific targets of renewable fuel to be used in the U.S. economy by mandating the blending of renewable fuels into gasoline and on- road diesel (""Transportation Fuels""). Renewable Identification Numbers (""""RINs"") are assigned to renewable fuels produced by or imported into the U.S. that are blended into Transportation Fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation. A refinery may meet its obligation under RFS by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with Transportation Fuels, by purchasing RINs in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing RINs. Because Monroe is able to blend only a small amount of renewable fuels, it must purchase the majority of its RINs requirement in the secondary market. Market prices for RINs have been volatile and marked by periods of sharp increases and decreases. However, in June 2023, the EPA finalized RFS volume requirements for 2023, 2024 and 2025, which has ameliorated the historical volatility in market prices for RINs. Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program We participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program (the ""CRAF Program""), which permits the U.S. military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating U.S. airlines during airlift emergencies, national emergencies or times of war. We have agreed to make available under the CRAF Program a portion of our international aircraft during the contract period that ends on October 31, 2030, with the opportunity to opt in or out of the program every two years. The CRAF Program has only been activated three times since it was created in 1951, most recently in 2021 to support the military's effort to evacuate people from Afghanistan following the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country.

Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 16 --- PAGE 19 END --- Item 1A. Risk Factors ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following material risk factors applicable to Delta. As described below, these risks could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future. Risk Factors Relating to Delta We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from a serious accident involving our aircraft or aircraft of our airline partners. An aircraft crash or other serious accident involving our aircraft or those of our airline partners could expose us to significant liability. Although we believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in the event that the coverage was not sufficient. In addition, any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare, alliance or joint venture partners could create a negative public perception about safety and reliability for aviation authorities and the public, which could harm our reputation, resulting in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and therefore harm our business. Breaches or lapses in the security of the technology systems we use and rely on could compromise the data stored within them and consequently expose us to liability, disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. As a regular part of our ordinary business operations, we process a high volume of information, including personal information about individuals we have a relationship with and other sensitive business information. The secure operation",600

Breaches or lapses in the security of the technology systems we use and rely on could compromise the data stored within them and consequently expose us to liability, disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. As a regular part of our ordinary business operations, we process a high volume of information, including personal information about individuals we have a relationship with and other sensitive business information. The secure operation of our networks and systems, and those of our business partners and third-party service providers, on which this type of information is processed is critical to our business operations and strategy. These networks and systems are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks, which we must manage. We expect unauthorized parties to continue attempting to gain access to our systems or information, or those of our business partners and third-party service providers, including through fraud or other means of deception, or introduction of malicious code, such as malware and ransomware. If successful, these actions could cause harm to our computer systems or compromise data stored on our computer networks or those of our business partners and third- party service providers, potentially causing us to incur remedial, legal and other costs, which could be material. Hardware or software we or our business partners or third-party service providers develop, acquire or use in connection with our systems may contain defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. As a result of these types of risks and regular attacks on our systems, we review and update procedures and processes to prevent and protect against unauthorized access to our systems and information and inadvertent misuse of data. In addition to assessing risk and reviewing our procedures, processes and technologies, we continue to educate our employees and contractors about these risks and to monitor, review and update the process and control requirements we expect third parties and vendors to leverage and implement for the protection of Delta information in their care. However, the constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all information security breaches or misuse of data. In addition, as cybercriminals become more sophisticated, the cost of proactive defensive measures continues to increase. We are also subject to evolving global privacy and security regulatory obligations and an increasing customer focus on privacy issues and data security in the United States and abroad, as well as to geopolitical risks associated with international data transfer. The compromise of our or our business partners' or third-party service providers' technology systems could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability, fines or other regulatory enforcement actions, disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. The costs to remediate these incidents could be material. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 17 --- PAGE 20 END --- Item 1A.

Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 17 --- PAGE 20 END --- Item 1A. Risk Factors Disruptions of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, possibly having a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions in our information technology capability could result from a technology error or failure impacting our internal systems, whether hosted internally at our data centers or externally at third-party locations, or large-scale external interruption in technology infrastructure support on which we depend, such as power, telecommunications or the internet. The operation of our technology systems and the use of related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of other sources of interruption, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. A significant individual, sustained or repeated failure of our information technology infrastructure, including third-party networks, software-as-a-service applications, cloud services, or technology that we utilize and on which we depend, could impact our operations and our customer service, result in loss of revenue, increased costs and damage our reputation. While we have initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to prevent or mitigate disruptions, we experienced a global outage caused by a faulty update by cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike in July 2024 that resulted in global information technology outages of Windows-based systems. The faulty software update significantly affected our information technology systems, disrupting our operations. The operational disruption resulted in flight delays and approximately 7,000 cancellations of Delta flights over five days, impacting 1.4 million customers. The CrowdStrike-caused outage and resulting operational disruption adversely impacted our results of operations as discussed in more detail in ""Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis."" While we continue to invest in improvements to our preventative initiatives and disaster recovery plans, the measures we have in place may not be adequate to prevent future business disruptions and any material adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business. Failure of the technology we use to perform effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are dependent on technology initiatives and capabilities to provide customer service and operational effectiveness in order to compete in the current business environment. For example, substantially all of our tickets are issued to our customers as electronic tickets, and a significant number of our customers check in for flights using our website, airport kiosks and our FlyDelta mobile application. We have made and continue to make significant investments in customer facing technology such as delta.com, the FlyDelta mobile application, in-flight wireless internet, check-in kiosks, customer service applications, application of biometric technology, airport information displays and related initiatives, including security for these initiatives. We have also invested in significant upgrades to technology infrastructure and other supporting systems and a transition to cloud-based technologies. The performance, reliability and security of the technology we use are critical to our ability to serve customers. If this technology does not perform effectively, including as a result of the implementation or integration of new or upgraded technologies or systems, our business and operations can be negatively affected, which could be material. As discussed above, the faulty CrowdStrike software update significantly affected our information technology systems, disrupting our operations. Additional failures of the technology we use or depend on could expose us to liability, disrupt our business and damage our reputation in the future.

As discussed above, the faulty CrowdStrike software update significantly affected our information technology systems, disrupting our operations. Additional failures of the technology we use or depend on could expose us to liability, disrupt our business and damage our reputation in the future. Our business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel. High fuel costs or cost increases, including in the cost of crude oil, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel. Fuel costs represented 19%, 21% and 24% of our operating expense in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Fuel prices are highly volatile and at times have adjusted substantially in relatively short periods of time. Between 2022 and 2024, our average fuel price per gallon has ranged from a monthly high of $4.25 in June 2022 to a monthly low of $2.29 in November 2024. We acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from Monroe and through strategic agreements associated with the refinery that Monroe has with third parties. The cost of the jet fuel we purchase under these arrangements remains subject to volatility, including from the cost of crude oil. In addition, we have historically purchased a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from Monroe. Our aircraft fuel purchase contracts alone do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on industry standard market price indices. Because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel, a significant rapid increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase. At times in the past, we often were not able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increases in fuel costs, and we may not be able to do so in the future. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 18 --- PAGE 21 END --- Item 1A. Risk Factors Significant extended disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel, including from Monroe, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or disputes involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation or taxes, changes in refining capacity or refining priorities, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may impact crude oil and jet fuel supply and could result in shortages in the future. Shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our business and results of operations. Unplanned disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could have a negative impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations. Disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure, interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil, work stoppages relating to organized labor issues, or damage from severe weather or other natural or man- made disasters, including acts of terrorism. If the refinery were to experience an unexpected interruption in operations, disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the financial benefits from the operation of the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs. If Monroe's cost of producing non-jet fuel products",600

If the refinery were to experience an unexpected interruption in operations, disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the financial benefits from the operation of the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs. If Monroe's cost of producing non-jet fuel products significantly exceeds the value it receives for those products, the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our commercial relationships with airlines in other parts of the world and the investments that we have in certain of those carriers may not produce the results or returns we expect. An important part of our strategy to expand our global network has been to develop and expand strategic relationships with a number of airlines through joint ventures and other forms of cooperation and support, including equity investments. These relationships and investments involve significant challenges and risks, including that joint ventures or cooperation agreements may be subject to ongoing review and renewal requirements and may not generate the expected financial results, or that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investments. For example, the DOT's approval of and antitrust immunity grant for our joint cooperation agreement with Aeroméxico is subject to a pending renewal application with the DOT, which was tentatively dismissed pursuant to an Order to Show Cause issued by the DOT on January 26, 2024. The existing immunity remains in effect pending final adjudication of the renewal application, the timing and outcome of which cannot be predicted at this time. We are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate. While we work closely with these carriers, we do not have control over their operations or business methods. To the extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period or their actions have a significant adverse effect on our operations, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If our commercial arrangements with any of these partners are not maintained, any investments or other assets associated with those partners could become impaired, and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. A significant disruption in, or other problems with respect to, the operations or performance of third parties on which we rely, including third-party carriers, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We rely on the operations and performance of third parties in a number of areas that are important to our business, including third-party regional carriers, international alliance partners and ground operation providers at some airports. While we have agreements with certain of these third parties that define expected service performance, we do not have direct control over their operations. To the extent that the operations of a third-party on which we rely is significantly disrupted or if these third parties experience significant performance issues (including failing to satisfy any applicable performance standards) or fail to meet any applicable compliance requirements, our revenue may be reduced, our expenses may be increased and our reputation may be harmed, any or all of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.",600

Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 19 --- PAGE 22 END --- Item 1A. Risk Factors Agreements governing our debt, including our credit facilities and our SkyMiles financing agreements, include financial and other covenants. Certain of these covenants impose restrictions on our business, and failure to comply with any of the covenants in these agreements could result in events of default. Our debt agreements, including our credit facilities and our SkyMiles financing agreements, contain various affirmative, negative and financial covenants. Certain of our debt agreements and our SkyMiles financing agreements contain minimum coverage ratios. A decline in these coverage ratios, including due to factors that are beyond our control, could trigger an early amortization event or, if applicable, require us to post additional collateral. Our SkyMiles financing agreements also restrict our ability to, among other things, change the policies and procedures of the SkyMiles program in a manner that would reasonably be expected to materially impair repayment of our SkyMiles debt. Complying with certain of the covenants in our debt agreements, and other restrictive covenants that may be contained in any future debt agreements, could limit our ability to operate our business and to take advantage of business opportunities that are in our long-term interest. While the covenants in our debt agreements are subject to important exceptions and qualifications, if we fail to comply with them and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, refinance the indebtedness subject to these covenants or take other mitigating actions, an event of default would result. These arrangements also contain other events of default customary for such financings. If an event of default were to occur, the lenders or noteholders could, among other things, declare outstanding amounts due and payable and where applicable and subject to the terms of relevant collateral agreements, repossess collateral, including aircraft or other valuable assets. In addition, an event of default or acceleration of indebtedness under one agreement could result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements. The acceleration of significant indebtedness could require us to seek to renegotiate, repay or refinance the obligations under our financing arrangements, and there is no assurance that such renegotiation or refinancing efforts would be successful. Employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of pilots, flight attendants, aircraft maintenance technicians, ground support personnel and other personnel. As of December 31, 2024, 20% of our workforce, primarily pilots, was unionized. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the Railway Labor Act, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. The Railway Labor Act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self-help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the Railway Labor Act have",600
chunk_028,delta,annual_report_2024,"ground support personnel and other personnel. As of December 31, 2024, 20% of our workforce, primarily pilots, was unionized. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the Railway Labor Act, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. The Railway Labor Act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self-help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted. Separately, the NLRA governs Monroe's relations with the union representing their employees, which generally allows self-help after a collective bargaining agreement expires. If we or our subsidiaries are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups in future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act or the NLRA, as the case may be. Strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business. Likewise, if third-party regional carriers with which we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our results can fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors. Our results of operations are impacted by a number of factors including seasonality and changing economic and other conditions beyond our control. Demand for air travel is typically higher in the June and September quarters, particularly in our international markets, because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year. The seasonal shifting of demand causes our financial results to vary on a quarterly basis. Changes in the value of our equity investments in other airlines and airline service companies can also be significant and cause fluctuations in our results. Other factors that may affect our results include severe weather conditions and natural disasters (or other environmental events), which could significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems. In addition, increases in the frequency, severity or duration of thunderstorms, hurricanes, typhoons, floods or other severe weather events, including from changes in the global climate and rising global temperatures, could result in increases in delays and cancellations, turbulence-related injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather, any of which could result in loss of revenue and higher costs. Because of fluctuations in our results from seasonality and other factors, results of operations for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for a future period and results of operations for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for an entire year.

Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 20 --- PAGE 23 END --- Item 1A. Risk Factors An environmental or other incident associated with the operation of the Monroe refinery could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results if insurance is unable to cover a significant liability. In addition, such an incident could damage our reputation. Monroe's refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions and natural catastrophes. Monroe could incur substantial losses, including cleanup costs, fines and other sanctions and third-party claims, and its operations could be interrupted, as a result of such an incident. Monroe's insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses, costs or liabilities, and Monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage. In addition, Monroe's ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control. If Monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations or consolidated financial position. In addition, because of our ownership of Monroe, the occurrence of an environmental or other incident could result in damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. The operation of the refinery by Monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation. Failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation applicable to Monroe could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results. Monroe's operations are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions, which are subject to change over time. Monroe could incur fines and other sanctions, cleanup costs and third-party claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental, health and safety requirements, which if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results. In addition, the enactment of new, more stringent environmental laws and regulations, including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for Monroe or restrict its operations. In particular, in administering the RFS, created by the U.S. Congress under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA created a program to ensure compliance with RFS mandates for the blending of renewable fuels into Transportation Fuels. RINs are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the U.S. that are blended into Transportation Fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation. A refinery may meet its obligation under RFS by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with Transportation Fuels, by purchasing RINs in the open market, or by a combination of blending and purchasing RINs. Because Monroe is able to blend only a small amount of renewable fuels, it must purchase the majority of its RINs obligation in the secondary market. As a result, Monroe is exposed to the market price of RINs. Historically, market prices for RINs have been volatile, marked by periods of sharp increases and decreases, including in response to speculation about what the EPA and/or the U.S. Congress will do with respect to compliance obligations. We cannot predict these actions or the future prices of RINs. Existing laws or",600

We cannot predict these actions or the future prices of RINs. Existing laws or regulations could change, and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum products may increase. Increases in the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into Monroe's products could limit the refinery's production if sufficient numbers of RINs are not available for purchase, or if relief from this requirement is not obtained, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results. Significant damage to our reputation and brand, including as a result of significant adverse publicity or inability to achieve certain sustainability goals, could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Maintaining our reputation and global brand is critical to our business. We operate in a highly visible and public environment with significant real-time exposure to traditional and social media. Adverse publicity, whether justified or not, can rapidly spread, including through social or digital media. In particular, passengers can use social media to portray interactions with Delta, without context, in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. To the extent we are unable to respond in a timely and appropriate manner to adverse publicity, our brand and reputation may be damaged. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 21 --- PAGE 24 END --- Item 1A. Risk Factors Our reputation and brand could also be adversely impacted by, among other things, failure to make progress toward and achieve our environmental sustainability goals, as well as public pressure from investors or policy groups to change our policies or negative public perception of the environmental impact of air travel. For example, we have established ambitious goals to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Achieving these ambitious goals will require significant capital investment from manufacturers and other stakeholders, as we are unable to achieve these goals using our existing fleet, current technologies and available fuel sources. We are continuing to develop our climate strategy and transition plan; however, our ability to execute on such a plan is subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, as it is dependent on the actions of governments and third parties and will require, among other things, significant capital investment, including from third parties, research and development from manufacturers and other stakeholders, along with government policies and incentives to reduce the cost, and incent production, of SAF and other technologies that are not presently in existence or available at scale. Significant damage to our reputation and brand could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results, including as a result of litigation related to any of these matters. If we lose senior management and other key employees and they are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills, or we otherwise fail to maintain our company culture, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to design and execute our business plans.

If we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees and we are not able to replace these persons with individuals with comparable skills, or we otherwise fail to maintain our company culture, our performance could be materially adversely impacted. Furthermore, we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified senior management and other key personnel as needed in the future. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 22 --- PAGE 25 END --- Item 1A. Risk Factors Risk Factors Relating to the Airline Industry Disease outbreaks or other public health threats, and measures implemented to combat them have had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our business. The measures governments and private parties implemented in order to stem the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the general concern about the virus among travelers, had a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel compared to historical levels, and consequently upon our business for an extended period. Similar disease outbreaks or public health threats that may arise in the future could have similarly adverse effects on our business. Our operations were, and could in the future be, negatively affected further if our employees are quarantined or sickened as a result of exposure to a disease outbreak, or as a result of a similar public health crisis, or if they are subject to additional governmental curfews or ""shelter in place"" health orders or similar restrictions. Measures restricting the ability of our airport or in-flight employees to come to work negatively impact our service or operations, all of which could negatively affect our business. We are unable to predict the extent to which disease outbreaks or other public health threats that may arise in the future may change our customers' behavior or travel patterns, which could have a material impact on our business. The degree to which any future disease outbreaks or public health threats may impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition is uncertain and will depend on future developments. Terrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events, or the fear or threat of any of these events, could have a significant adverse effect on our business. Despite significant security measures at airports and airlines, the airline industry remains a high profile target for terrorist groups. We rely on government provided threat intelligence and utilize private sources to constantly monitor for threats from terrorist groups and individuals, including from violent extremists both internationally and domestically, with respect to direct threats against our operations and in ways not directly related to the airline industry. In addition, the impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world, including airspace, in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of commercial aircraft by parties to those conflicts can be significant. Security events, primarily from external sources but also from potential insider threats, also pose a significant risk to our passenger and cargo operations. These events could",600

In addition, the impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world, including airspace, in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of commercial aircraft by parties to those conflicts can be significant. Security events, primarily from external sources but also from potential insider threats, also pose a significant risk to our passenger and cargo operations. These events could include random acts of violence and could occur in public areas that we cannot control. Terrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events, or the fear or threat of any of these events, even if not made directly on or involving the airline industry, could have a significant negative impact on us by discouraging passengers from flying, leading to decreased ticket sales and increased refunds. In addition, potential costs from these types of events include increased security costs, impacts from avoiding flight paths over areas in which conflict is occurring or could occur, such as flight redirections or cancellations, reputational harm and other costs. If any or all of these types of events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The global airline industry is highly competitive and, if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. The airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, schedules (both timing and frequency), operational reliability, services, products, customer service and loyalty programs. Consolidation in the airline industry, changes in international alliances, the creation of immunized joint ventures and the rise of subsidized government-sponsored international carriers have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry, resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources, more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 23 --- PAGE 26 END --- Item 1A. Risk Factors Our domestic operations are subject to significant competition from traditional network carriers, including American Airlines and United Airlines, national point-to-point carriers, including Alaska Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines, and other discount or ultra-low-cost carriers, including Allegiant Air, Avelo Airlines, Breeze Airways, Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines. Some of these carriers have business models primarily focused on maintaining low costs, with the intention of providing service at lower fares to destinations served by Delta. In particular, we face significant competition at our domestic hubs and key airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity. We also face competition in small- to medium-sized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers. Our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure. If we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers, including from point-to-point carriers on certain international routes. Through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to and beyond traditional European, Asian and Latin American gateway cities. Similarly, foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior U.S. passenger traffic beyond traditional U.S. gateway cities",600

If we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers, including from point-to-point carriers on certain international routes. Through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to and beyond traditional European, Asian and Latin American gateway cities. Similarly, foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior U.S. passenger traffic beyond traditional U.S. gateway cities through these relationships. In particular, several joint ventures among U.S. and foreign carriers, including several of our joint ventures as well as those of our competitors, have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate networks, schedules, pricing, sales and inventory. In addition, alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers, including SkyTeam, the Star Alliance (among United Airlines, Lufthansa German Airlines, Air Canada and others) and the oneworld alliance (among American Airlines, British Airways, Qantas and others) have enhanced competition in international markets. The airline industry also faces competition from surface transportation and technological alternatives such as virtual meetings, teleconferencing or videoconferencing. Increased competition from these sectors in both the domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Extended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports in which we operate or significant problems associated with a type of aircraft or engine we operate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The airline industry is heavily dependent on business models that concentrate operations in major airports in the United States and throughout the world. An interruption or disruption at an airport or facility where we have significant operations, whether resulting from air traffic control delays, failure of computer systems or technology infrastructure, weather events or natural disasters, or performance issues from third-party service providers, if sustained for an extended period of time, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, the airline industry is heavily dependent on a limited number of aircraft and engine manufacturers whose products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements. Any significant problems associated with an aircraft or engine type that we operate, including new aircraft or engine types, such as design defects, mechanical problems, contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public leading to customer avoidance, or adverse actions by the FAA resulting in limitations on use or grounding could have a negative impact on our operations if we are not able to substitute or replace the affected aircraft or engine type. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The airline industry is subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements, which is costly and could materially adversely affect our business. Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs and may have material adverse effects on our business. There have also been recent legal developments in the United States that may change the way historical obligations have been interpreted or applied.

Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 24 --- PAGE 27 END --- Item 1A. Risk Factors Inefficiencies in the U.S. air traffic control system, which is regulated by the FAA, can result in delays and disruptions of air traffic, especially during peak travel periods in certain congested markets. Failure to implement measures to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for U.S. air travel increases, having a material adverse effect on our operations. Failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner, and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers, may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Airport slot access is subject to government regulation and changes in slot regulations or allocations could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in airports subject to such regulations or allocations or otherwise adversely affect an airline's business. Certain of our hubs are among the most congested airports in the United States and have been, and could in the future be, the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights and/or increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day. Air traffic control inefficiencies can also enhance these pressures. Other laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations, reduce revenues or otherwise impact our business. The industry is heavily taxed. Additional taxes and fees, if implemented, could negatively impact our results of operations. As an international carrier, we are subject to a wide variety of U.S. and foreign laws that affect trade, including tariff and trade policies, export and import requirements, taxes, monetary policies and other restrictions and charges. In particular, the imposition of significant tariffs with respect to aircraft that we are not able to mitigate could substantially increase our costs, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Some of our operations are in high-risk legal compliance environments. Failure to comply with trade sanctions and restrictions, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the ""FCPA"") and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions, as well as other applicable laws or regulations could result in litigation, assessment of damages, imposition of penalties or other consequences, any or all of which could harm our reputation and have an adverse effect on our financial results. In certain circumstances, we also may be subject to consequences of the failure of our airline partners to comply with laws and regulations, including U.S. laws to which they may be subject such as the FCPA. We and other U.S. carriers are subject to U.S. and foreign data privacy and security laws that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate and which are continuously evolving, requiring ongoing monitoring and updates to",600

In certain circumstances, we also may be subject to consequences of the failure of our airline partners to comply with laws and regulations, including U.S. laws to which they may be subject such as the FCPA. We and other U.S. carriers are subject to U.S. and foreign data privacy and security laws that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate and which are continuously evolving, requiring ongoing monitoring and updates to our privacy and information security programs. Although we dedicate significant resources to manage compliance with global privacy and information security obligations, this challenging regulatory environment may pose material risks to our business, including increased operational burdens and costs, regulatory enforcement, and legal claims or proceedings. The airline industry is subject to many forms of environmental regulation, including but not limited to regulation of hazardous substances, increased regulation to reduce emissions and other risks associated with climate change. The cost of compliance with more stringent environmental regulations, failure to comply with existing or future regulations or failure to otherwise manage the risks of climate change effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business. Many aspects of our operations are subject to evolving and increasingly stringent federal, state, local and international laws governing environmental protection. Compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations could require capital investment and increase operational costs, and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties and reputational harm. For example, in 2024, the EPA finalized regulations defining certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (""PFAS"") as ""hazardous substances"" under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (""CERCLA""), and the EPA also finalized regulations establishing drinking water standards for certain PFAS under the Safe Drinking Water Act. PFAS are man-made chemicals that have been used in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products, including the firefighting foams used to extinguish fuel-based fires at airports and refineries. Numerous states have adopted regulations governing PFAS as well. The EPA's final rule under CERCLA, and analogous state laws, could subject airports, airlines, and refineries, among others, to potential liability for cleanup of historical PFAS contamination associated with use of PFAS-containing firefighting foam. In addition, some states have adopted legislation prohibiting the manufacture, sale, distribution and/or use of firefighting foam containing intentionally added PFAS, which may require the transition to alternative fire suppression systems. The ultimate impact and associated cost to Delta of these legislative and regulatory developments related to PFAS, including firefighting foam, cannot be predicted at this time. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 25 --- PAGE 28 END --- Item 1A. Risk Factors Future regulatory action concerning climate change, aircraft emissions and noise could have a significant effect on the airline industry. In order to address aircraft carbon dioxide emissions, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a United Nations specialized agency, formally adopted a global, market-based emission offset program known as CORSIA. This program establishes a goal for the aviation industry to achieve carbon-neutral growth in international aviation beginning in 2021 through the use of carbon offsets and/or lower carbon aviation fuel. ICAO set the baseline for establishing airlines' obligations under CORSIA for 2021 to 2023 based on 2019 travel, and in 2022 set a new, more stringent CORSIA baseline of 85% of 2019, which will apply from 2024 through 2035. Because certain CORSIA program details remain to be developed and could potentially be affected by political developments in participating countries or the results",600
chunk_036,delta,annual_report_2024,"global, market-based emission offset program known as CORSIA.

ICAO set the baseline for establishing airlines' obligations under CORSIA for 2021 to 2023 based on 2019 travel, and in 2022 set a new, more stringent CORSIA baseline of 85% of 2019, which will apply from 2024 through 2035. Because certain CORSIA program details remain to be developed and could potentially be affected by political developments in participating countries or the results of the initial phases of the program, the impact of CORSIA cannot be predicted at this time. However, compliance with CORSIA is expected to increase operating costs for airlines that operate internationally. In addition to CORSIA, we may face a patchwork of regulation of aircraft emissions in the U.S. and abroad and could become subject to further taxes, charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions. For example, in 2023, the EU adopted updated legislation on the EU Emissions Trading System (""ETS""). That legislation continues in effect the so-called ""stop-the-clock"" provision whereby EU ETS does not apply to flights to or from locations outside the EEA, Switzerland or the UK until 2027. The legislation also provides for a review of the effectiveness of CORSIA in 2026 that could, if CORSIA is not deemed sufficiently effective, lead to the application of EU ETS to all flights departing the EU and EEA. Also in 2023, the EU adopted legislation that will impose a SAF mandate on fuel supplied at EU airports. The mandate initially requires that, of the jet fuel supplied in the EU, 2% must be SAF beginning in 2025, and the percentage increases incrementally over time to 70% in 2050. This mandate is expected to increase the cost of SAF in the EU. In 2024, the UK also adopted SAF mandate legislation, and other countries are considering mandates. Additional regulation could result in taxation, regulatory or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations and significant costs for the airline industry, including Delta. In addition to direct costs, such regulation could result in increased fuel costs passed through from fuel suppliers affected by any such regulations. While the specific nature of future actions is hard to predict, new laws or regulations related to environmental matters adopted in the U.S. or other countries could impose significant additional costs on or otherwise adversely affect our operations. Certain airports have also adopted, and others could in the future adopt, greenhouse gas emission or climate-related goals and requirements that could impact our operations or require us to make changes or investments in our infrastructure. In addition to risks from potential changes to environmental regulation and policy, the transition to lower-carbon technologies, such as SAF, or changes in consumer preferences resulting from a negative perception of the environmental impact of air travel could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, lower-carbon technologies such as SAF and direct air capture technologies are currently not available at scale and may take decades to develop, and the cost to transition to them could be prohibitively expensive without appropriate government policies and incentives in place. Because of the global nature of our business, unfavorable economic or political conditions in the markets in which we operate or volatility in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of the discretionary nature",600

Because of the global nature of our business, unfavorable economic or political conditions in the markets in which we operate or volatility in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of the discretionary nature of air travel, the airline industry has been cyclical and particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Because we operate globally, our business is subject to economic and political conditions throughout the world. During periods of unfavorable or volatile economic conditions in the economy in the U.S. or abroad, demand for air travel can be significantly impacted as business and leisure travelers choose not to travel, seek alternative forms of transportation for short trips or conduct business using technological alternatives. If unfavorable economic conditions occur, particularly for an extended period, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions, may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Our international operations are an important part of our route network. Political disruptions and instability around the world can negatively impact the demand and network availability for air travel. Additionally, any deterioration in global trade relations, such as increased tariffs or other trade barriers, could result in a decrease in the demand for international air travel. ITEM 1B.

As a result, we require all employees and contractors with access to Delta's information to complete annual training, which is updated as new technology, security and privacy issues emerge. All new employees are required to complete training within 30 days of hire. We also conduct, at least annually, other training and employee education activities, including through awareness programs and campaigns. We engage assessors, consultants, auditors and other third parties to perform assessments of our cybersecurity program with the intent to identify areas for continued improvement, as well as to ensure ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements to which we are subject. In connection with certain regulatory requirements, we are required to engage third parties to assess our cybersecurity controls. Our cybersecurity program is subject to TSA requirements applicable to certain TSA-regulated airport and aircraft operators, including the requirement to develop a TSA-approved implementation plan describing measures we are taking to improve cybersecurity and to assess the effectiveness of those measures on an ongoing basis. Our processes also address cybersecurity threat risks associated with our use of third-party service providers, including those who have access to our data or our systems. Third-party risks are included within our risk assessment of vendors, as well as our cybersecurity-specific risk identification program. In addition, cybersecurity considerations affect the selection and oversight of third-party service providers. We perform diligence on third parties, particularly those that have access to our systems, data or facilities that house such systems or data, and continually monitor cybersecurity threat risks identified through such diligence. Additionally, we generally require those third parties that could introduce significant cybersecurity risk to us to agree by contract to manage their cybersecurity risks in specified ways, and to agree to be subject to cybersecurity audits. We regularly test our incident response processes through table-top exercises to ensure they continue to be effective as our business and the cybersecurity threat landscape evolve. Our incident response processes are designed to guide the actions we take to prepare for, detect, respond to and recover from cybersecurity incidents.

At most airports, we have entered into use agreements which provide for the non-exclusive use of runways, taxiways and other improvements and facilities. Landing fees under these agreements normally are based on the number of landings and weight of aircraft. These leases and use agreements generally run for periods of less than one year to 30 years or more, and often contain provisions for periodic adjustments of lease rates, landing fees and other charges applicable under that type of agreement. We also lease aircraft maintenance, equipment maintenance and air cargo facilities at several airports. Our facility leases generally require us to pay the cost of providing, operating and maintaining such facilities, including, in some cases, amounts necessary to pay debt service on special facility bonds issued to finance their construction. We also lease computer facilities, marketing offices, reservations offices and other off-airport facilities in certain locations for varying terms. We own our Atlanta reservations center, other real property in Atlanta and reservations centers in North Dakota and Minnesota. Refinery Operations Our Monroe subsidiaries own and operate the Trainer refinery and related assets in Pennsylvania. The facilities include pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the Northeastern U.S., including our New York hubs at LaGuardia and JFK. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 30 --- PAGE 33 END --- Item 3. Legal Proceedings ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Capacity Antitrust Litigation In July 2015, a number of purported class action antitrust lawsuits were filed alleging that Delta, American, United and Southwest had conspired to restrain capacity. The lawsuits were filed in the wake of media reports that the U.S. Department of Justice had served civil investigative demands upon these carriers seeking documents and information relating to this subject. The lawsuits have been consolidated into a single Multi-District Litigation proceeding in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. In August 2023, the Court denied the defendants' motions for summary judgment that had been pending for over two years. In Fall 2023, we moved to certify the decision for an interlocutory appeal or for reconsideration, and briefing related to that motion is now complete. We believe the claims in these cases are without merit and are vigorously defending these lawsuits. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes and other financial information as well as the material risk factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 2024 Financial Overview Our 2024 operating income was $6.0 billion, an improvement of $474 million compared to 2023, and operating income, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $6.0 billion, a decrease of $318 million compared to 2023. Operating income, adjusted in 2023 excluded one-time pilot agreement expenses and other items. The changes in operating income and operating income, adjusted are primarily resulting from increases in both revenue and operating expenses as described below. As a result of our strong performance in 2023 and 2024, we paid profit sharing of $1.4 billion in February 2024 to our employees and will pay another $1.4 billion in February 2025 in recognition of these achievements. Revenue. Compared to 2023, our 2024 operating revenue increased $3.6 billion, or 6%, primarily due to a 6% increase in capacity driven by continued strength in demand for domestic and international travel and premium products, as well as an increase in revenue related to refinery sales to third parties. Total revenue, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure) increased in 2024 by $2.3 billion, or 4.3%, compared to 2023. Adjustments were to exclude revenue related to refinery sales to third parties. In July 2024, our operations were significantly disrupted by the CrowdStrike-caused outage. We estimate that this disruption led to a direct revenue impact of approximately $380 million related to approximately 7,000 flight cancellations over five days, which reduced our expected year-over-year capacity growth by approximately 0.4 percentage points during 2024. Operating Expense. Total operating expense increased $3.1 billion, or 6%, compared to 2023, primarily resulting from higher employee-related costs from increased wages and related expenses, higher volume-related expenses associated with the 6% increase in capacity and an increase in expenses related to refinery sales to third parties. The CrowdStrike-caused outage and operational recovery resulted in approximately $170 million of additional operating expenses primarily due to customer expense reimbursements and crew-related costs. Fuel expense was approximately $50 million lower than it would have been as a result of the flight cancellations. Total operating expense, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure) increased $2.7 billion, or 5%, compared to 2023. Current year adjustments were primarily to exclude expenses related to refinery sales to third parties, while prior year adjustments also excluded the pilot agreement and related expenses. Our total operating cost per available seat mile (""CASM"") of 19.30 cents was comparable to 2023, primarily due to lower fuel expense and a 6% increase in capacity offset by higher expenses associated with the increase in capacity and related to refinery sales to third parties. Non-fuel unit costs (""CASM-Ex"", a non-GAAP financial measure), which excludes fuel, expenses related to refinery sales to third parties and other items, increased 2.8% to 13.54 cents compared to 2023. Non-Operating Results. Total non-operating expense was $1.3 billion in 2024, compared to total non-operating income of $87 million in 2023, primarily due to mark-to-market gains on certain of our equity investments in 2023 partially offset by lower expenses in 2024 associated with our debt reduction initiatives. Cash Flow. During 2024, operating activities generated $8.0 billion, primarily from ticket sales and the sale of SkyMiles to our partners. Total cash sales of SkyMiles to American Express were $7.4 billion during 2024, an increase of approximately 8% compared",600

Cash Flow. During 2024, operating activities generated $8.0 billion, primarily from ticket sales and the sale of SkyMiles to our partners. Total cash sales of SkyMiles to American Express were $7.4 billion during 2024, an increase of approximately 8% compared to 2023. Investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of approximately $3.7 billion, primarily for $5.1 billion of capital expenditures, partially offset by $1.1 billion of net redemptions of short-term investments. After adjusting for certain activities, these results generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) in 2024. Also, during 2024 we had cash outflows of approximately $4.0 billion primarily related to repayment of our debt and finance leases, including approximately $1.1 billion for early repayments and the remainder from scheduled maturities. Our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and aggregate principal amount committed and available to be drawn under our revolving credit facilities (""liquidity"") at December 31, 2024 was $6.1 billion.

Domestic revenue in 2024 was above 2023 levels as we experienced strong demand across the domestic network. We generated higher growth in premium products revenue compared to main cabin with the delivery of new aircraft that include more premium seat capacity and an increase in yield in premium products compared to main cabin, as we see more consumers choosing these premium offerings. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 35 --- PAGE 38 END --- Item 7. MD&A - Results of Operations International International passenger revenue for 2024 increased 5% with capacity up 8% compared to 2023. Revenue in each international region increased in 2024, with the Pacific growing at the greatest rate as we continue to restore capacity in the region. Demand for transatlantic travel remained at high levels throughout 2024 with revenue increasing slightly on flat capacity compared to 2023. Revenue growth in the Atlantic was led by demand for travel to European leisure destinations and our premium product offerings. Latin America region revenue increased during 2024 compared to 2023, due to strong demand for leisure destinations in South America and the Caribbean on a 15% increase in capacity. We continued to build on the strength of our joint venture with LATAM in South America through additional routes, greater network connectivity, and a more streamlined airport experience. The Pacific region benefited from improved demand for travel to the region, particularly to South Korea and Japan, on 32% increased capacity. Our performance in South Korea benefited from the strength of our joint venture partnership with Korean Air, which enables passengers to more seamlessly connect to over 80 destinations in Asia. Revenue from flights to Japan increased due to higher demand for travel from the United States due in part to weakness in the Japanese Yen compared to the U.S. dollar.

Salaries and Related Costs. The increase in salaries and related costs primarily resulted from the implementation of base pay increases for eligible employees of 5% effective June 1, 2024 and for Delta pilots on January 1, 2024. In June 2024 we also increased our minimum starting wage for domestic mainline employees to $19 per hour. Salaries and related costs also increased due to additional crew-related costs resulting from the CrowdStrike-caused outage and costs to support increased traffic. Employee benefits increased on higher healthcare expenses and from travel passes awarded to employees in recognition of their hard work through the summer. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our employee benefit plans. Aircraft Fuel and Related Taxes. Fuel expense decreased $503 million compared to 2023 primarily due to a 12% decrease in the market price of jet fuel partially offset by a 5% increase in consumption on a 6% increase in capacity, resulting in a 1% improvement in fuel efficiency. Fuel expense was also approximately $50 million lower than it would have been as a result of the 7,000 flight cancellations over the five-day period following the CrowdStrike- caused outage.

Ancillary Businesses and Refinery. Ancillary businesses and refinery includes expenses associated with refinery sales to third parties, aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties and our vacation package operations. The increase in these expenses was primarily related to higher refinery sales to third parties, which increased $1.3 billion compared to 2023. See ""Refinery Segment"" below for additional details on the refinery's operations, including third party refinery sales. Landing Fees and Other Rents. The increase in landing fees and other rents resulted from higher rates charged by airports following extensive redevelopment projects at numerous facilities and more flights compared to 2023. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 37 --- PAGE 40 END --- Item 7. MD&A - Results of Operations Pilot agreement and related expenses. In the March 2023 quarter, Delta pilots ratified a new four-year Pilot Working Agreement effective January 1, 2023. The agreement includes numerous work rule changes and pay rate increases during the four-year term, including an initial pay rate increase of 18%. The agreement also includes a provision for a one-time payment made upon ratification in the March 2023 quarter of $735 million. Additionally, we recorded adjustments to other benefit-related items of approximately $130 million. Other. The increase in other is primarily due to higher volume-related expenses associated with increased capacity, such as flight crew and other employee travel and incidental costs and the impact of service recovery costs including customer expense reimbursements from the CrowdStrike-caused outage.

Interest expense, net includes interest expense and interest income. This decreased compared to 2023 primarily on reduced interest expense resulting from our debt reduction initiatives, which was partially offset by lower interest income. We are reducing the total amount of interest expense by pre-paying our debt in addition to periodic amortization payments and scheduled maturities. During 2024, we made $4.0 billion of payments on debt and finance lease obligations, including approximately $1.1 billion of early repayments. This included early extinguishment of $844 million in principal related to a portion of the SkyMiles Term Loan and various secured and unsecured notes, and approximately $280 million for finance leased aircraft that were purchased. We continue to seek opportunities to pre-pay our debt, in addition to periodic amortization payments and scheduled maturities, during 2025 and beyond.

Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was 26% and 18% for 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate is impacted by net pre-tax income or loss recognized on our equity investments, which are considered capital assets for tax purposes, because realized capital losses can only be deducted against realized capital gains. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $2.7 billion of U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards which we are expecting to utilize during 2025. These net operating loss carryforwards were primarily generated in 2020 and do not expire. We expect our annual effective tax rate to be between 23% and 25% for 2025. In certain periods, we may have adjustments to our net deferred tax liabilities as a result of changes in prior year estimates, mark-to-market adjustments on our equity investments and tax laws enacted during the period, which will impact the effective tax rate for that period.

MD&A - Refinery Segment Refinery Segment The refinery operated by our wholly owned subsidiary Monroe primarily produces gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Monroe has agreements in place to exchange the non-jet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations. The jet fuel produced and procured through exchanging gasoline and diesel fuel produced by the refinery typically provides approximately 200,000 barrels per day, or approximately 75% of our consumption, for use in our airline operations. The refinery regularly optimizes its sales and exchange activities of non-jet fuel products based on market conditions and the availability of counterparties for exchanges. Refinery revenues increased in 2024, primarily driven by the increase in third party refinery sales on reduced exchanges of non-jet fuel products due to the availability of exchange counterparties, and reduced production in 2023 related to the planned maintenance turnaround. The refinery operating income decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 mainly due to lower industry refining margins.

A refinery may meet its obligation by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels, by purchasing Renewable Identification Numbers (""""RINs"") in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing RINs. Because Monroe is able to blend only a small amount of renewable fuels, it must purchase the majority of its RINs requirement in the secondary market. Monroe incurred $203 million in RINs compliance costs during 2024, compared to $323 million incurred in 2023.

Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 3 9 --- PAGE 42 END --- Item 7. MD&A - Financial Condition and Liquidity Financial Condition and Liquidity As of December 31, 2024, we had $6.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and aggregate principal amount committed and available to be drawn under our revolving credit facilities (""liquidity""). We expect to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months with cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash equivalents and cash flows from operations. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements. Sources and Uses of Liquidity Operating Activities Operating activities in 2024 provided $8.0 billion of cash flow compared to $6.5 billion in 2023. We expect to continue generating cash flows from operations during 2025. Our operating cash flow is impacted by the following factors: Seasonality of Advance Ticket Sales. We sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customer's travel date. When we receive a cash payment at the time of sale, we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability. The",600

We expect to continue generating cash flows from operations during 2025. Our operating cash flow is impacted by the following factors: Seasonality of Advance Ticket Sales. We sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customer's travel date. When we receive a cash payment at the time of sale, we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability. The air traffic liability typically increases during the winter and spring months as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the summer peak travel season and decreases during the summer and fall months. Sale of Miles to Participating Companies. Customers earn miles based on their spending with participating companies such as credit card, retail, ridesharing, car rental and hotel companies with which we have marketing agreements to sell miles. Payments are typically due to us monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period. Our most significant contract to sell miles relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express. Total cash sales to American Express were $7.4 billion during 2024, an increase of 8% compared to the prior year. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the cash sales from marketing agreements. Fuel. Fuel expense represented approximately 19% of our total operating expense during 2024. The market price for jet fuel is volatile, which can impact the comparability of our periodic cash flows from operations. The average fuel price per gallon decreased in 2024. We expect continued higher market price volatility compared to historical levels due to geopolitical events. As capacity increased throughout the year, fuel consumption was higher in 2024 than 2023. We expect fuel consumption to increase in 2025 aligned with capacity, partially offset by improvements in the fuel efficiency of our fleet. We expect our commitment to environmental sustainability to depend on increased use of SAF, which is not presently available at scale or at prices competitive to jet fuel. While we do not expect a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements in the near-term from the use of SAF, we are unable to predict the financial impact of increased use of SAF on our Consolidated Financial Statements over the longer term as government policies and incentives for, and sufficient third-party investment in, SAF are necessary to make its use in larger quantities commercially and economically feasible. Employee Benefit Obligations. We sponsor defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. Our funding obligations for defined benefit plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (""ERISA"") and any additional applicable legislation. We had no minimum funding requirements in 2024, and estimate that there will be approximately $80 million of minimum funding requirements under these plans in 2025. Payments to defined contribution plans were approximately $1.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2024. In addition, we have employee benefit obligations relating primarily to projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans. Benefit payments for these obligations are expected to be approximately $500 million on an annual basis over the next five years. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our employee benefit obligations. Profit Sharing.

Our broad-based employee profit sharing program provides that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit, as defined by the terms of the program, we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees. In determining the amount of profit sharing, the program defines profit as pre-tax profit adjusted for profit sharing and certain other items. We pay profit sharing annually in February. We paid $1.4 billion in 2024 to our employees in recognition of their contributions toward meeting our financial goals. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded $1.4 billion in profit sharing expense based on 2024 pre-tax profit, which we will pay to employees in February 2025. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 40 --- PAGE 43 END --- Item 7. MD&A - Financial Condition and Liquidity Contract Carrier Obligations. We have certain estimated minimum fixed obligations under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. These minimum amounts are based on the required minimum levels of flying by the regional carriers under the respective agreements and assumptions regarding the costs associated with such minimum levels of flying. As of December 31, 2024 the total of these minimum amounts was $7.7 billion and range from approximately $700 million to $1.8 billion on an annual basis over the next five years. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our contract carrier obligations. Operating Lease Obligations. As described further in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2024 we had a total of $8.4 billion of minimum operating lease obligations. These minimum lease payments range from approximately $600 million to $1.0 billion on an annual basis over the next five years. Other Obligations. We have certain purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services, including, but not limited to, aviation-related, maintenance, technology, sponsorships, marketing, insurance and other third-party services and products. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $9.3 billion of such obligations, which range from approximately $400 million to $1.3 billion on an annual basis over the next five years. Income Taxes. We expect to utilize our remaining net operating loss carryforwards during 2025. Once these are exhausted, under current tax laws, we expect to be a partial cash taxpayer during 2025. Investing Activities Short-Term Investments. In 2024, we redeemed a net of $1.1 billion in short-term investments. During 2024 our investment strategy shifted to no longer include short-term investments and accordingly as of December 31, 2024 we have no short-term investments and do not expect any further activity in the foreseeable future. See Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these investments. Capital Expenditures. Our capital expenditures (i.e., property and equipment additions in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (""cash flows statement"")) were $5.1 billion and $5.3 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively.

We have committed to future aircraft purchases and have obtained, but are under no obligation to use, long-term financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of the aircraft. Our expected 2025 capital spend of approximately $5.0 billion, which may vary depending on financing decisions, will be primarily for aircraft, including deliveries and advance deposit payments, as well as fleet modifications and technology enhancements. As described in Part I, Item 1. ""Business - Environmental Sustainability,"" aircraft fleet renewal is an important component of our environmental sustainability strategy and the path to achievement of our ambitious climate goals, which will continue to require extensive capital investment in future periods. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our aircraft purchase commitments, which totaled approximately $18.3 billion as of December 31, 2024. New York-LaGuardia Redevelopment. In 2024, we substantially completed all construction for the replacement of Terminals C and D of the New York- LaGuardia Airport with a new state-of-the-art terminal facility. The project cost approximately $4.2 billion and was funded through debt issuance, existing cash and a Port Authority contribution of approximately $500 million. We entered into loan agreements to fund a portion of the construction, which are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (""balance sheets"") as debt with the proceeds reflected as restricted cash. Using funding primarily provided by these arrangements, we spent approximately $300 million, $500 million and $650 million during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We expect only a small amount of spend in 2025 as the project is finalized. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the debt related to the redevelopment project. Los Angeles International Airport (""LAX"") Construction. In 2023, we substantially completed all construction for the LAX upgrade and modernization project that consolidates Terminals 2 and 3, as well as connects these terminals to the Tom Bradley International Terminal. The project cost approximately $2.5 billion. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 41 --- PAGE 44 END --- Item 7. MD&A - Financial Condition and Liquidity Asubstantial majority of the project costs were funded through the Regional Airports Improvement Corporation (""RAIC""), a California public benefit corporation, using a revolving credit facility provided by a group of lenders. The credit facility was executed in 2017 and we have guaranteed the obligations of the RAIC under the credit facility. Loans made under the credit facility are being repaid with the proceeds from the City of Los Angeles' (the ""City"") purchase of completed project assets. Under the lease agreement and subsequent project component approvals by the City's Board of Airport Commissioners, the City appropriated approximately $1.8 billion to purchase completed project assets, representing the maximum allowable reimbursement by the City.

In 2024, we had cash outflows of approximately $4.0 billion related to repayments of our debt and finance leases, including approximately $1.1 billion of early repayments. This included early extinguishment of $844 million in principal related to a portion of the SkyMiles Term Loan and various secured and unsecured notes, and approximately $280 million for finance leased aircraft that were purchased. We continue to seek opportunities to pre-pay our debt, in addition to periodic amortization payments and scheduled maturities, during 2025 and beyond. During 2024, Fitch and S&P Global upgraded their credit ratings of Delta to BBB-, an investment grade rating. When combined with Moody's, which affirmed our credit rating (Baa3) and upgraded its outlook for Delta to positive in 2024, we have now achieved investment-grade ratings across the major credit rating agencies. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the effect of these ratings changes on our debt agreements. The principal amount of our debt and finance leases was $16.2 billion at December 31, 2024. Future Debt Obligations. As described further in Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2024, scheduled maturities of our debt in 2025 are $1.8 billion, with maturities from 2026 through 2029 ranging between $600 million and $2.3 billion annually. As of December 31, 2024, scheduled maturities after 2029 aggregate to $6.6 billion. In addition, we are obligated to make periodic interest payments at fixed and variable rates, depending on the terms of the applicable debt agreements. Based on applicable interest rates and scheduled debt maturities as of December 31, 2024, these interest obligations total approximately $3.0 billion and range from approximately $200 million to $600 million on an annual basis over the next five years. Finance Lease Obligations. As described further in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2024 we had a total of $897 million of minimum finance lease obligations. These minimum lease payments range from approximately $30 million to $400 million on an annual basis over the next five years. Capital Returns to Shareholders. During 2024, we continued our quarterly dividend program with $0.10 per share payments in the March 2024 and June 2024 quarters and $0.15 per share payments in the September 2024 and December 2024 quarters. Total dividend payments during the year ended December 31, 2024 were $321 million.

MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates Critical Accounting Estimates Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP"") that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Accordingly, the actual results may differ materially from these estimates. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, unless otherwise noted below. Loyalty Program Our SkyMiles loyalty program generates customer loyalty by rewarding customers with incentives to travel on Delta. This program allows customers to earn miles by flying on Delta, Delta Connection carriers and other airlines that participate in the loyalty program. When traveling, customers earn miles primarily based on the passenger's loyalty program status, fare class and ticket price. Customers can also earn miles through participating companies. Miles are redeemable by customers for air travel on Delta and other participating airlines, access to Delta Sky Club and other program awards. To facilitate transactions with participating companies, we sell miles to non-airline businesses and other airlines. The loyalty program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple performance obligations (1) passenger ticket sales earning miles and (2) sale of miles to participating companies. Passenger Ticket Sales Earning Miles. Passenger ticket sales earning miles provide customers with (1) miles earned and (2) air transportation, which are each considered performance obligations. We value each performance obligation on a standalone basis. To value the miles earned, we consider the quantitative value a passenger receives by redeeming miles for a ticket rather than paying cash, which is referred to as equivalent ticket value (""ETV""). Our estimate of ETV is adjusted for miles that are not likely to be redeemed (""mileage breakage""). We use statistical models to estimate mileage breakage based on historical redemption patterns. A change in assumptions regarding the redemption activity for miles or the estimated fair value of miles expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years. We recognize mileage breakage proportionally during the period in which the remaining miles are actually redeemed. At December 31, 2024, the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the SkyMiles program was $8.8 billion. A hypothetical 10% change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in an impact of less than 1% of total operating revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024. We defer revenue for the miles when earned and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and transportation is provided. We record the air transportation portion of the passenger",600

A hypothetical 10% change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in an impact of less than 1% of total operating revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024. We defer revenue for the miles when earned and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and transportation is provided. We record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize passenger revenue when we provide transportation or if the ticket goes unused. A hypothetical 10% increase in our estimate of the ETV of a mile would have decreased total operating revenue by less than 1% for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred associated with the miles earned. Sale of Miles to Participating Companies. Customers earn miles based on their spending with participating companies, such as credit card, ridesharing, retail, car rental and hotel companies, with which we have marketing agreements to sell miles. Our contracts to sell miles under these marketing agreements have multiple performance obligations. Payments are typically due to us monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period, and the initial terms of our marketing contracts are from one to thirteen years. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, total cash sales from marketing agreements related to our loyalty program were $7.4 billion, $6.9 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, which are allocated to travel and other performance obligations, as discussed below. Our most significant arrangement to sell miles relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express. Our agreements with American Express provide for joint marketing, grant certain benefits to Delta-American Express co-branded credit card holders (""cardholders"") and American Express Membership Rewards program participants, and allow American Express to market its services or products using our customer database. Cardholders earn miles for making purchases using co-branded cards, and certain cardholders may also receive baggage fee waivers, lounge access, priority boarding and other benefits while traveling on Delta. Additionally, participants in the American Express Membership Rewards program may exchange their points for miles under the loyalty program. We sell miles to American Express which are then provided to their customers under the co- brand credit card program and the Membership Rewards program. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 43 --- PAGE 46 END --- Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates We account for marketing agreements, including those with American Express, by allocating the consideration to the individual products and services delivered. We allocate the value based on the relative selling prices of those products and services, which generally consist of award travel, baggage fee waivers, lounge access, priority boarding and the use of our brand. We determine our best estimate of the selling prices by using a discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions, including (1) the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed, (2) ETV for the award travel obligation adjusted for mileage breakage, (3) published rates on our website for baggage fees, Delta Sky Club lounge access and other benefits while traveling on Delta, (4) brand value (using estimated royalties generated from the use of our brand) and (5) volume discounts provided to certain partners.

We defer the amount allocated to award travel as part of loyalty program deferred revenue and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and transportation is provided. Revenue allocated to services performed in conjunction with a passenger's flight, such as baggage fee waivers, is recognized as travel-related services in passenger revenue when the related service is performed. Revenue allocated to Delta Sky Club lounge access is recognized as miscellaneous in other revenue as access is provided. Revenue allocated to the remaining performance obligations, primarily brand value, is recorded as loyalty program in other revenue as miles are delivered. The timing of mile redemptions can vary widely; however, the majority of new miles have historically been redeemed within two years of being earned. The loyalty program deferred revenue classified as a current liability represents our estimate of revenue expected to be recognized in the next twelve months based on projected redemptions, while the balance classified as a noncurrent liability represents our estimate of revenue expected to be recognized beyond twelve months. For additional information on our significant accounting policies related to the loyalty program, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Passenger Ticket Sales We defer sales of passenger tickets to be flown by us or that we sell on behalf of other airlines in our air traffic liability. Passenger revenue is recognized when we provide transportation. For tickets that we sell on behalf of other airlines, we reduce the air traffic liability when consideration is remitted to those airlines. The air traffic liability primarily includes sales of passenger tickets with scheduled departure dates in the future and travel credits, which can be applied as payment toward the cost of a ticket. We periodically evaluate the estimated air traffic liability and may record adjustments in our Consolidated Statement of Operations (""income statement""). These adjustments relate primarily to tickets that expire unused (""ticket breakage"") and items for which final settlement occurs in periods subsequent to the sale of the related tickets such as refunds, exchanges and transactions with other airlines. We estimate the value of ticket breakage and recognize revenue at the scheduled flight date. Our ticket breakage estimates are primarily based on historical experience, ticket contract terms and customers' travel behavior. At December 31, 2024, the aggregate air traffic liability balance was $7.1 billion. A hypothetical 10% change in the amount of tickets estimated to expire unused would result in an impact of less than 1% of total operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024. For additional information on our significant accounting policies related to passenger ticket sales, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We apply a fair value-based impairment test to the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis (as of October 1) and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. We assess the value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets under either a qualitative or quantitative approach. Under a",600

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We apply a fair value-based impairment test to the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis (as of October 1) and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. We assess the value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets under either a qualitative or quantitative approach. Under a qualitative approach, we consider various market factors, including certain of the key assumptions listed below. We analyze these factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset may be impaired, we use the quantitative approach to assess the asset's fair value and the amount of the impairment. Under a quantitative approach, we calculate the fair value of the asset incorporating the key assumptions listed below into our calculation. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 44 --- PAGE 47 END --- Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates When we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit by considering both comparable public company multiples (a market approach) and projected discounted future cash flows (an income approach). When we perform a quantitative impairment assessment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, fair value is estimated based on (1) recent market transactions, where available, (2) the royalty method for the Delta tradename (which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename) or (3) projected discounted future cash flows (an income approach). Key Assumptions. The key assumptions in our impairment tests include (1) forecasted revenues, expenses and cash flows, (2) current discount rates, (3) observable market transactions and (4) anticipated changes to the regulatory environment (e.g., changes in slot access and/or availability, additional Open Skies agreements or changes to antitrust approvals). These assumptions are consistent with those that hypothetical market participants would use. Because we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, actual transaction amounts may differ materially from these estimates. In addition, when performing a qualitative valuation, we consider the amount by which the intangible assets' fair values exceeded their respective carrying values in the most recent fair value measurements calculated using a quantitative approach. Changes in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment or a change from indefinite-lived to definite-lived. Factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) reduced profitability resulting from lower passenger mile yields or higher input costs, (3) lower passenger demand as a result of weakened U.S. and global economies or other factors, (4) prolonged interruption to our operations, (5) changes to the regulatory environment, (6) operational or performance changes by other airlines and (7) strategic changes to our operations leading to diminished utilization of the intangible assets. Goodwill. Our goodwill balance, which is related to the airline segment, was $9.8 billion at December 31, 2024. Identifiable Intangible Assets. Our identifiable intangible assets, which are related to the airline segment, had a net carrying amount of $6.0 billion at December 31, 2024, of which $5.9 billion related to indefinite-lived intangible assets. Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized and consist of routes, slots, the Delta tradename and assets related to alliances and collaborative arrangements.

Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized and consist of routes, slots, the Delta tradename and assets related to alliances and collaborative arrangements. Definite-lived assets consist primarily of marketing and maintenance service agreements. During the December 2024 quarter, we performed qualitative assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including applicable factors noted above, and determined that there was no indication that the assets were impaired. Our qualitative assessments include analyses and weighting of all relevant factors that impact the fair value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We previously performed quantitative assessments in the December 2023 quarter, noting no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. For additional information on our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets' significant accounting policies and the related fair values and book values, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. These plans are generally closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals. As of December 31, 2024, the funded status for these plans recorded on our balance sheets was $938 million, which is the net of our benefit obligation of $15.0 billion and plan assets of $15.9 billion. We had no minimum funding requirements in 2024, and estimate that there will be approximately $80 million of minimum funding requirements under these plans in 2025. The most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations, plan assets and net periodic cost/(benefit) are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and life expectancy of plan participants. Discount Rate. We determine our discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high-quality fixed income investments and yield-to-maturity analyses specific to our estimated future benefit payments for each plan. We used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 5.71% and 5.31% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Expected Long-Term Rate of Return. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on plan-specific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data. Modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically. We also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets. We review our rate of return on plan assets assumptions annually. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 45 --- PAGE 48 END --- Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates The investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to earn a long-term return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target while taking an acceptable level of risk and maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay current benefits and other cash obligations of the plan. This is achieved by investing in a globally diversified mix of public and private equity, fixed income, real assets, hedge funds and other assets and instruments.

This is achieved by investing in a globally diversified mix of public and private equity, fixed income, real assets, hedge funds and other assets and instruments. The expected long-term rate of return on our defined benefit pension plan assets is 6.97%. The impact of a 0.50% change in weighted average discount rate and 1.00% change in expected long-term rate of return on assets are shown in the table below: Benefit plan effects of change in assumptions used Effect on 2025 Effect on Accrued Pension Change in Assumption Pension Cost/(Benefit) Liability at December 31, 2024 0.50% decrease in weighted average discount rate $ 12 million $ 674 million 0.50% increase in weighted average discount rate $ (12) million $ (624) million 1.00% decrease in expected long-term rate of return on assets $ 154 million $ = 1.00% increase in expected long-term rate of return on assets $ (154) million $ — Life Expectancy. Changes in life expectancy may significantly impact our benefit obligations and future net periodic cost/(benefit). Each year we review information published by the Society of Actuaries and other publicly available information to develop our best estimate of life expectancy for purposes of measuring pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations. Funding. Our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by ERISA and any additional applicable legislation. Under current legislation, any required funding would be amortized over a rolling 15-year period and calculated using a discount rate of no less than 4.75% through 2030. While recent legislation makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable, factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements. Estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements. Assumptions include, among other things, the actual and projected market performance of assets, statutory requirements and demographic data for participants. Investments Valued at Net Asset Value (""NAV"") Per Share. On an annual basis we assess the potential for adjustments to the fair value of all investments. These investments valued using NAV as a practical expedient are typically valued on a monthly or quarterly basis by third-party administrators, valuation agents or fund managers with an annual audit performed by an independent third-party, but certain of these investments have a lag in the availability of data. We solicit valuation updates from the investment fund managers and use their information and corroborating data from public markets to determine any needed fair value adjustments.

Included below are reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used within this Form 10-K to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations below may not calculate exactly due to rounding. These reconciliations include certain adjustments to GAAP measures to provide comparability between the reported periods, if applicable, as indicated below: ¢ | MTM adjustments and settlements on hedges. Mark-to-market (""MTM"") adjustments are defined as fair value changes recorded in periods other than the settlement period. Such fair value changes are not necessarily indicative of the actual settlement value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period, and therefore we remove this impact to allow investors to better understand and analyze our core performance. Settlements represent cash received or paid on hedge contracts settled during the applicable period. * One-time pilot agreement expenses. During 2023, Delta pilots ratified a new four-year Pilot Working Agreement effective January 1, 2023. The agreement includes a provision for a one-time payment made upon ratification in the March 2023 quarter of $735 million.

Market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In an effort to manage our exposure to these risks, we may enter into derivative contracts and may adjust our derivative portfolio as market conditions change. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our derivative contracts.

In an effort to manage our exposure to these risks, we may enter into derivative contracts and may adjust our derivative portfolio as market conditions change. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our derivative contracts. We expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and stockholders' equity. The following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel, the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk. For these and other reasons, the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results. Fuel Price Risk Changes in fuel prices materially impact our results of operations. A one cent increase in the cost of jet fuel per gallon would result in approximately $40 million of additional annual fuel expense based on annual consumption of approximately four billion gallons of jet fuel. Our derivative contracts to hedge the financial risk from changing fuel prices are related to Monroe's inventory. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our debt and lease obligations. Market risk associated with our fixed-rate debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value from an increase in interest rates. Market risk associated with our variable-rate debt and variable-rate leases relates to the potential negative impact to future earnings from an increase in interest rates. At December 31, 2024, we had $14.5 billion of fixed-rate debt, $0.9 billion of variable-rate debt and $0.4 billion of variable-rate leases. The rates used in our variable-rate debt are based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""), or another index rate, which in certain cases is subject to a floor. An increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $620 million at December 31, 2024 and would have increased the annual interest expense on our variable-rate debt and variable-rate leases by $12 million. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have revenue, expense and equity investments denominated in foreign currencies. To manage exchange rate risk, we execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable. From time to time, we may also enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts. At December 31, 2024 we had no open foreign currency options or forward contracts. As of December 31, 2024, our investments denominated in foreign currencies (AirFrance-KLM, China Eastern, Hanjin-KAL and LATAM) were recorded at a fair value of $1.6 billion. A 10% change in the value of those respective currencies against the U.S. dollar would have an approximately $160 million impact on our financial statements. Equity Investment Risk We own equity investments in a number of airlines and airline service companies, which are subject to equity price risk. We often hold our equity securities for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur in the future, impacting the volatility of our financial results. During 2024, we recorded a net loss of $319 million related to the valuation of our fair value investments compared to a net gain of $1.3 billion in 2023.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""consolidated financial statements""). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 11, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an",600

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 11, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Employee Benefit Plans - Net Asset Value Per Share (NAV) Asset Valuation Description of the Matter At December 31, 2024, the fair value of the Company's benefit plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis totaled $15.7 billion, of which $12.4 billion do not have a readily determinable fair value and are measured at NAV as a practical expedient. Management determines the fair value of NAV assets by applying the methodologies described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. Auditing the Company's estimates of the fair value of its NAV assets required significant judgment, primarily resulting from the lag in the availability of data provided by the investment fund managers. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 53 --- PAGE 56 END --- How We Addressed the Matter We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's in Our Audit accounting for the fair value measurement of its NAV assets, including controls over management's assessment of the significant inputs and estimates affecting the fair value measurement.

Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 53 --- PAGE 56 END --- How We Addressed the Matter We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's in Our Audit accounting for the fair value measurement of its NAV assets, including controls over management's assessment of the significant inputs and estimates affecting the fair value measurement. To test the fair value of plan assets measured at NAV, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the valuation methodologies used by the Company and comparing significant inputs and underlying data used in the Company's valuations to third-party source documentation. Additionally, we performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the changes to the Company's net periodic benefit that would result from changes in the fair value measurement, compared the Company's asset performance results to applicable third-party benchmarks, and assessed management's historical accuracy of estimating fair value by performing retrospective review procedures comparing the Company's estimates of fair value as of the prior year end to the fair value NAV in the investment's audited financial statements made available during the current year. Loyalty Program - Mileage Breakage Description of the Matter How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit At December 31, 2024, the Company's aggregate current and noncurrent loyalty program deferred revenue balance was $8.8 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $3.8 billion of revenue classified as loyalty travel awards within passenger revenue and $3.3 billion of revenue classified as loyalty program revenue within other revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. As disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company defers revenue for mileage credits earned and recognizes loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and services are provided. In accounting for its loyalty program deferred revenue, the Company estimates the amount of mileage credits outstanding that are not expected to be redeemed (mileage breakage). The Company recognizes mileage breakage proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are redeemed. Under the Company's loyalty program, mileage credits do not expire. Therefore, the Company uses statistical models to estimate mileage breakage based on historical redemption patterns. Auditing the mileage breakage estimate for the loyalty program required significant judgment. In particular, there is complexity and subjectivity in estimating mileage breakage based on expectations of future redemption patterns due to the absence of historical expirations as the Company's mileage credits do not expire. We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's accounting for its loyalty program, including controls over management's review of the estimation of the mileage breakage and the completeness and accuracy of the data underlying the mileage breakage estimate. To test the mileage breakage estimate, our audit procedures included, among others, involving an actuarial specialist to assist in assessing the method and assumptions used by the Company to develop the mileage breakage estimate and to independently develop a range of mileage breakage estimates and compare to the Company's estimate. Additionally, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying mileage data used to develop the mileage breakage estimate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 2006.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation Delta Air Lines, Inc., a Delaware corporation, provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the United States (""U.S."") and around the world. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Delta Air Lines, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""). We are not the primary beneficiary of, nor do we have a controlling financial interest in, any variable interest entity. Accordingly, we have not consolidated any variable interest entity. We have marketing alliances with other airlines to enhance our access to domestic and international markets. These arrangements may include codesharing, reciprocal loyalty program benefits, shared or reciprocal access to passenger lounges, joint promotions, common use of airport gates and ticket counters, office co-location and other marketing agreements. We have received antitrust immunity for certain marketing arrangements, which enables us to offer a more integrated route network and develop common sales, marketing and discount programs for customers.

Use of Estimates We are required to make estimates and assumptions when preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Recent Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Standards In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") No. 2023-07, ""Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures."" This standard requires disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items by reportable segment. We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2024. See Note 14, ""Segments,"" for further information regarding our segment reporting. Standards Effective in Future Years Income Taxes. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, ""Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures."" This standard enhances disclosures related to income taxes, including the rate reconciliation and information on income taxes paid. This ASU is effective beginning January 1, 2025. Upon adoption of this ASU we expect to include certain additional disclosures in the effective income tax rate reconciliation in the footnotes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, ""Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)."" This standard requires disclosure of specific information about costs and expenses and becomes effective January 1, 2027. We are assessing the impact of this ASU and, upon adoption, may be required to include certain additional disclosures in the footnotes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments Short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased are classified as cash and cash equivalents. Investments with maturities of greater than three months, but not in excess of one year, when purchased were classified as short-term investments and stated at fair value. Investments with maturities beyond one year when purchased may be classified as short-term investments if they are expected to be available to support our short-term liquidity needs.

As part of our strategy to mitigate the cost of the refining margin reflected in the price of jet fuel, our wholly owned subsidiary, Monroe Energy, LLC (""Monroe""), operates the Trainer oil refinery. Refined products (finished goods) and feedstock and blendstock inventories (work-in-process) are carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We use jet fuel in our airline operations that is produced by the refinery, procured through the exchanges with third parties of gasoline, diesel and other refined products (""non-jet fuel products"") the refinery produces and purchased directly from third parties. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Costs include the raw material consumed plus direct manufacturing costs (such as labor, utilities and supplies) as incurred and an applicable portion of manufacturing overhead. Expendables Parts and Supplies. Inventories of expendable parts related to flight equipment, which cannot be economically repaired, reconditioned or reused after removal from the aircraft, are carried at moving average cost and charged to aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs as consumed. An allowance for obsolescence is provided over the remaining useful life of the related fleet. We also provide allowances for parts identified as excess or obsolete to reduce the carrying costs to the lower of cost or net realizable value. These parts are estimated to have residual value of 5% of the original cost. Accounting for Refinery Related Buy/Sell Agreements To the extent that we receive jet fuel for non-jet fuel products exchanged under buy/sell agreements, we account for these transactions as nonmonetary exchanges. We have recorded these nonmonetary exchanges at the carrying amount of the non-jet fuel products transferred within aircraft fuel and related taxes on the income statement. Derivatives Changes in fuel prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates impact our results of operations.

We record property and equipment at cost and depreciate or amortize these assets on a straight-line basis to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life for leasehold improvements is the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life. Depreciation and amortization expense related to our property and equipment was $2.5 billion, $2.3 billion and $2.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Residual values for owned aircraft, engines, spare parts and simulators are generally 5% to 10% of cost. We capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to develop and implement software and amortize those costs over an estimated useful life of three to fifteen years. Included in the depreciation and amortization expense discussed above, we recorded $324 million, $340 million and $307 million for amortization of capitalized software for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The net book value of these assets, which are included in information technology-related assets above, totaled $933 million and $932 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We review flight equipment, ROU assets and other long-lived assets used in operations for impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired. Factors which could be indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to (1) a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other long-lived assets from operations, (2) significant changes in the estimated useful life, (3) significant changes in projected cash flows, (4) permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and (5) changes to the regulatory environment. For long-lived assets held for sale, we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell. To determine whether impairments exist for aircraft used in operations, we group assets at the fleet type level or at the contract level for aircraft operated by third-party regional carriers (i.e., the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel and labor costs and other relevant factors. If an asset group is impaired, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the asset group's carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.

Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 62 --- PAGE 65 END --- Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Manufacturers' Credits We periodically receive credits in connection with the acquisition of aircraft and engines or in connection with delivery delays or manufacturing defects. These credits are deferred until the aircraft and engines are delivered, and then applied as a reduction to the cost of the related equipment. Maintenance Costs We record maintenance costs related to our mainline and regional fleets in aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs and regional carrier expense, respectively. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, except for costs incurred under power-by-the-hour contracts, which are expensed based on actual hours flown. Power-by-the-hour contracts transfer certain risk to third-party service providers and fix the amount we pay per flight hour or per flight cycle to the service provider in exchange for maintenance and repairs under a predefined maintenance program. Modifications that enhance the operating performance or extend the useful lives of airframes or engines are capitalized and amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter. Advertising Costs We expense advertising costs in passenger commissions and other selling expenses in the year the advertising first takes place. Advertising expense was $438 million, $347 million and $302 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Commissions and Merchant Fees Passenger sales commissions and merchant fees are recognized in passenger commissions and other selling expenses when the related revenue is recognized. NOTE 2. REVENUE RECOGNITION Passenger Revenue Passenger revenue is composed of passenger ticket sales, loyalty travel awards and travel-related services performed in conjunction with a passenger's flight. Passenger revenue by category ‘Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2024 2023 2022 Ticket $ 45,096 $ 43,596 $ 35,626 Loyalty travel awards 3,841 3,462 2,898 Travel-related services 1,957 1,851 1,694 Total passenger revenue $ 50,894 $ 48,909 $ 40,218 Ticket Passenger Tickets. We defer sales of passenger tickets to be flown by us or that we sell on behalf of other airlines in our air traffic liability. Passenger revenue is recognized when we provide transportation. For tickets that we sell on behalf of other airlines, we reduce the air traffic liability when consideration is remitted to those airlines. The air traffic liability primarily includes sales of passenger tickets with scheduled departure dates in the future and travel credits, which can be applied as payment toward the cost of a ticket. We periodically evaluate the estimated air traffic liability and may record adjustments in our income statement. These adjustments relate primarily to tickets that expire unused (""ticket breakage"") and items for which final settlement occurs in periods subsequent to the",600

These adjustments relate primarily to tickets that expire unused (""ticket breakage"") and items for which final settlement occurs in periods subsequent to the sale of the related tickets such as refunds, exchanges and transactions with other airlines. We recognized approximately $6.5 billion, $7.4 billion and $4.2 billion in passenger revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, that had been recorded in our air traffic liability balance at the beginning of those periods. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 63 --- PAGE 66 END --- Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Ticket Breakage. We estimate the value of ticket breakage and recognize revenue at the scheduled flight date. Our ticket breakage estimates are primarily based on historical experience, ticket contract terms and customers' travel behavior. Regional Carriers. Our regional carriers include both third-party regional carriers with which we have contract carrier agreements (""contract carriers"") and Endeavor Air, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary. Our contract carrier agreements are primarily structured as capacity purchase agreements where we purchase all or a portion of the contract carrier's capacity and are responsible for selling the seat inventory we purchase. We record revenue related to our capacity purchase agreements in passenger revenue and the related expenses in regional carrier expense. See Note 10, ""Commitments and Contingencies,"" for additional information regarding contract carrier agreements. Loyalty Travel Awards Loyalty travel awards revenue is related to the redemption of mileage credits (""miles"") for travel. We recognize loyalty travel awards revenue in passenger revenue as miles are redeemed and transportation is provided. See below for discussion of our loyalty program accounting policies. Travel-Related Services Travel-related services are primarily composed of services performed in conjunction with a passenger's flight, including baggage fees, administrative fees and on-board sales. We recognize revenue for these services when the related transportation service is provided. Loyalty Program Our SkyMiles loyalty program generates customer loyalty by rewarding customers with incentives to travel on Delta. This program allows customers to earn miles by flying on Delta, Delta Connection carriers and other airlines that participate in the loyalty program. When traveling, customers earn miles primarily based on the passenger's loyalty program status, fare class and ticket price. Customers can also earn miles through participating companies. Miles are redeemable by customers for air travel on Delta and other participating airlines, access to Delta Sky Club and other program awards. To facilitate transactions with participating companies, we sell miles to non-airline businesses and other airlines. The loyalty program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple performance obligations (1) passenger ticket sales earning miles and (2) sale of miles to participating companies. Passenger Ticket Sales Earning Miles. Passenger ticket sales earning miles provide customers with (1) miles earned and (2) air transportation, which are each considered performance obligations. We value each performance obligation on a standalone basis. To value the miles earned, we consider the quantitative value a passenger receives by redeeming miles for a ticket rather than paying cash, which is referred to as equivalent ticket value (""ETV""). Our estimate of ETV is adjusted for miles that are not likely to be",600

To value the miles earned, we consider the quantitative value a passenger receives by redeeming miles for a ticket rather than paying cash, which is referred to as equivalent ticket value (""ETV""). Our estimate of ETV is adjusted for miles that are not likely to be redeemed (""mileage breakage""). We use statistical models to estimate mileage breakage based on historical redemption patterns. A change in assumptions regarding the redemption activity for miles or the estimated fair value of miles expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years. We recognize mileage breakage proportionally during the period in which the remaining miles are actually redeemed. We defer revenue for the miles when earned and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and transportation is provided. We record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize passenger revenue when we provide transportation or if the ticket goes unused. Sale of Miles to Participating Companies. Customers earn miles based on their spending with participating companies, such as credit card, ridesharing, retail, car rental and hotel companies, with which we have marketing agreements to sell miles. Our contracts to sell miles under these marketing agreements have multiple performance obligations. Payments are typically due to us monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period, and the initial terms of our marketing contracts are from one to thirteen years. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, total cash sales from marketing agreements related to our loyalty program were $7.4 billion, $6.9 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, which are allocated to travel and other performance obligations, as discussed below. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 64 --- PAGE 67 END --- Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Our most significant arrangement to sell miles relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express. Our agreements with American Express provide for joint marketing, grant certain benefits to Delta-American Express co-branded credit card holders (""cardholders"") and American Express Membership Rewards program participants, and allow American Express to market its services or products using our customer database. Cardholders earn miles for making purchases using co-branded cards, and certain cardholders may also receive baggage fee waivers, lounge access, priority boarding and other benefits while traveling on Delta. Additionally, participants in the American Express Membership Rewards program may exchange their points for miles under the loyalty program. We sell miles to American Express which are then provided to their customers under the co- brand credit card program and the Membership Rewards program. We account for marketing agreements, including those with American Express, by allocating the consideration to the individual products and services delivered. We allocate the value based on the relative selling prices of those products and services, which generally consist of award travel, baggage fee waivers, lounge access, priority boarding and the use of our brand. We determine our best estimate of the selling prices by using a discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions, including (1) the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed, (2) ETV for the award travel obligation adjusted for mileage breakage,",600

We defer the amount allocated to award travel as part of loyalty program deferred revenue and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and transportation is provided. Revenue allocated to services performed in conjunction with a passenger's flight, such as baggage fee waivers, is recognized as travel-related services in passenger revenue when the related service is performed. Revenue allocated to Delta Sky Club lounge access is recognized as miscellaneous in other revenue as access is provided. Revenue allocated to the remaining performance obligations, primarily brand value, is recorded as loyalty program in other revenue as miles are delivered. Current Activity of the Loyalty Program. Miles are combined in one homogeneous pool and are not separately identifiable. Therefore, the revenue is comprised of miles that were part of the loyalty program deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period as well as miles that were issued during the period. The table below presents the activity of the current and noncurrent loyalty program deferred revenue, and includes miles earned through travel and miles sold to participating companies, which are primarily through marketing agreements.

Passenger Taxes and Fees We are required to charge certain taxes and fees on our passenger tickets, including U.S. federal tr ‘ansportation taxes, federal security charges, airport passenger facility charges and foreign arrival and departure taxes. These taxes and fees are assessments on the customer for which we act as a collection agent and these amounts are not included in passenger revenue.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Each fair value measurement is classified into one of the following levels based on the information used in the valuation: + Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets. + Level 2. Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly. + Level 3.

Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents generally consist of money market funds. Restricted cash equivalents are recorded in other noncurrent assets and prepaid expenses and other on our balance sheets and generally consist of money market funds, time deposits, commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit, which primarily relate to proceeds from debt issued to finance, among other things, a portion of the construction costs for our new terminal facilities at New York's LaGuardia Airport as well as certain self-insurance obligations and airport commitments. The fair value of these cash equivalents is based on a market approach using prices generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. Short-Term Investments. The fair values of our short-term investments were based on a market approach using industry standard valuation techniques that incorporate observable inputs such as quoted market prices, interest rates, benchmark curves, credit ratings of the security and other observable information.

See Note 4, ""Investments,"" for further information on our long-term investments. Fuel Hedge Contracts. A portion of our derivative contracts may be negotiated over-the-counter with counterparties without going through a public exchange. Accordingly, our fair value assessments give consideration to the risk of counterparty default (as well as our own credit risk). Such contracts would be classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The remainder of our hedge contracts may be comprised of futures contracts, which are traded on a public exchange. These contracts would be classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Our derivative contracts to hedge the financial risk from changing fuel prices are related to Monroe's inventory. Our fuel hedge portfolio may consist of a combination of options, swaps or futures. Option and swap contracts are valued under income approaches using option pricing models and discounted cash flow models, respectively, based on data either readily observable in public markets, derived from public markets or provided by counterparties who regularly trade in public markets. Futures contracts and options on futures contracts are traded on a public exchange and valued based on quoted market prices. We recognized losses of $31 million, $6 million and $394 million on our fuel hedge contracts in aircraft fuel and related taxes on our income statement for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 14, ""Segments,"" for further information on our Monroe refinery segment. NOTE 4. INVESTMENTS We have developed strategic relationships with a number of airlines and airline services companies through joint ventures and other forms of cooperation and support, including equity investments. Our equity investments reinforce our commitment to these relationships and generally enhance our ability to offer input to the investee on strategic issues and direction, in some cases through representation on the board of directors of the investee. Fair Value Investments. Changes in the valuation of investments accounted for at fair value are recorded in gain/(loss) on investments, net in our income statement within non-operating expense and are driven by changes in stock prices, foreign currency fluctuations and other valuation techniques for investments in companies without publicly-traded shares.

Our investment is subject to contractual transfer restrictions until September 2025 and thereafter will remain subject to certain, more limited transfer restrictions.

We have provided credit support for the Revolving Equipment Notes Facility which effectively guarantees the Wheels Up payment obligations. As a result, and consistent with our fair value option election, we recorded the immaterial fair value of the guarantee in other noncurrent liabilities on our balance sheet. Other Investments This category includes various investments that are accounted for at fair value or under the equity method, depending on our ownership interest and the level of influence conveyed by our investment. Among others, this category includes our equity method investments in Virgin Atlantic and JFK IAT Member LLC and our fair value investment in CLEAR. Virgin Atlantic. The carrying value of our investment in Virgin Atlantic remains zero as of December 31, 2024. We maintain our 49% equity interest and continue to track our share of Virgin Atlantic's losses under the equity method of accounting. These previously unrecognized losses are only recorded to the extent we make additional investments in Virgin Atlantic (i.e., additional shareholder support). As of December 31, 2024, we have approximately $480 million of unrecognized equity method losses related to our 49% interest in Virgin Atlantic. CLEAR.

We have a long-term agreement with IAT to sublease space in Terminal 4 through 2043 (""Sublease"") which requires us to pay certain fixed management fees. We determined that the investment is a VIE and assessed whether we have a controlling financial interest in IAT. Our rights under the Sublease, with respect to management of Terminal 4, are consistent with rights granted to an anchor tenant under a standard airport lease. Accordingly, we do not consolidate this entity in our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOTE 5. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets relate to the airline segment. We apply a fair value-based impairment test to the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis (as of October 1) and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. We assess the value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets under either a qualitative or quantitative approach. Under a qualitative approach, we consider various market factors, including certain of the key assumptions listed below. We analyze these factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset may be impaired, we use the quantitative approach to assess the asset's fair value and the amount of the impairment. Under a quantitative approach, we calculate the fair value of the asset incorporating the key assumptions listed below into our calculation. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 69 --- PAGE 72 END --- Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements We value goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily using market and income approach valuation techniques. These measurements include the following key assumptions (1) forecasted revenues, expenses and cash flows, (2) current discount rates, (3) observable market transactions and (4) anticipated changes to the regulatory environment (e.g., changes in slot access and/or availability, additional Open Skies agreements or changes to antitrust approvals). These assumptions are consistent with those that hypothetical market participants would use. Because we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, actual transaction amounts may differ materially from these estimates. We recognize an impairment charge if the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Changes in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment or a change from indefinite-lived to definite-lived. Factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) reduced profitability resulting from lower passenger mile yields or higher input costs, (3) lower passenger demand as a result of weakened U.S. and global economies or other factors, (4) prolonged interruption to our operations, (5) changes to the regulatory environment, (6) operational or performance changes by other airlines and (7) strategic changes to our operations leading to diminished utilization of the intangible assets.

Identifiable Intangible Assets. Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized and consist of routes, slots, the Delta tradename and assets related to alliances and collaborative arrangements. Definite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of marketing and maintenance service agreements and are amortized on a straight-line basis or under the undiscounted cash flows method over the estimated economic life of the respective agreements. Costs incurred to renew or extend the term of an intangible asset are expensed as incurred. During the December 2024 quarter, we performed qualitative assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including applicable factors noted above, and determined that there was no indication that the assets were impaired. Our qualitative assessments include analyses and weighting of all relevant factors that impact the fair value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We previously performed quantitative assessments in the December 2023 quarter, noting no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.

All variable rates are equal to SOFR (generally subject to a floor) or another index rate plus a specified margin. Early Settlement of Outstanding Loans and Notes During 2024, through early principal repayments and open market repurchases, we extinguished an aggregate principal amount of $844 million related to a portion of the SkyMiles Term Loan and various secured and unsecured notes. Collectively, these payments resulted in a $39 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which is recorded in non-operating expense in our income statement. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 71 --- PAGE 74 END --- Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Availability Under Revolving Facilities As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $3.1 billion undrawn and available under our revolving credit facilities. Corporate Revolving Credit Facility During the September 2024 quarter, Delta received a second investment grade credit rating, which satisfied the collateral release conditions under the Corporate Revolving Credit Facility. As a result, the liens on collateral, including our Pacific route authorities and certain related other assets, were released during 2024. Additionally, the minimum collateral coverage ratio and minimum liquidity covenants were replaced by minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum asset coverage ratio covenants. Fair Value of Debt Market risk associated with our fixed- and variable-rate debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings, respectively, from an increase in interest rates. The fair value of debt, shown below, is principally based on reported market values, recently completed market transactions and estimates based on interest rates, maturities, credit risk and underlying collateral. Debt is primarily classified as Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Fair value of outstanding debt (in millions) December 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Net carrying amount $ 15,347 $ 18,610 Fair value $ 15,300 $ 18,400 Covenants Our debt agreements contain various affirmative, negative and financial covenants. For example, certain credit facilities, including our SkyMiles financing agreements, contain, among other things, a minimum liquidity covenant.

LEASES We lease property and equipment under finance and operating leases. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, we record the related asset and obligation at the present value of the fixed minimum lease payments over the term. Many of our leases include rental escalation clauses, renewal options and/or termination options that are factored into our determination of lease payments when appropriate. We do not separate lease and nonlease components of contracts, except for regional aircraft and information technology (""IT"") assets as discussed below. We use the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value, when readily determinable. As the rate implicit in the lease is rarely readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate, which is based on the estimated interest rate for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease at commencement date. Some of our aircraft lease agreements include provisions for residual value guarantees. These guarantees represent an immaterial portion of our lease liability. Aircraft As of December 31, 2024, including aircraft operated by our regional carriers, we leased 170 aircraft, of which 55 were under finance leases and 115 were operating leases. Our aircraft leases had remaining lease terms of three months to 11 years.

Aircraft As of December 31, 2024, including aircraft operated by our regional carriers, we leased 170 aircraft, of which 55 were under finance leases and 115 were operating leases. Our aircraft leases had remaining lease terms of three months to 11 years. In addition, we have regional aircraft leases that are embedded within our capacity purchase agreements and included in the ROU asset and lease liability. We allocated the consideration in each capacity purchase agreement to the lease and nonlease components based on their relative standalone fair values. Lease components of these agreements consist of 119 aircraft as of December 31, 2024 and nonlease components primarily consist of flight operations, in-flight and maintenance services. We determined our best estimate of the standalone fair value of the individual components by considering observable information including rates paid by our wholly owned subsidiary, Endeavor Air, Inc., and rates published by independent valuation firms. See Note 10, ""Commitments and Contingencies,"" for additional information about our capacity purchase agreements. Airport Facilities Our facility leases are primarily for space at approximately 300 airports around the world that we serve. These leases reflect our use of airport terminals, office space, cargo warehouses and maintenance facilities. We generally lease space from government agencies that control the use of the airport, and as a result, these leases are classified as operating leases. The remaining lease terms vary from one month to 29 years. At the majority of the U.S. airports, the lease rates depend on airport operating costs or use of the facilities and are reset at least annually. Because of the variable nature of the rates, these leases are not recorded on our balance sheets. Some airport facilities have fixed payment schedules, the most significant of which is New York-JFK which comprises the majority of our ground and other operating right of use asset and lease liability. For those airport leases with fixed payment schedules, we have recorded a ROU asset and lease liability representing the fixed component of the lease payments. See Note 8, ""Airport Redevelopment,"" for more information on our significant airport redevelopment projects. Other Ground Property and Equipment We lease certain IT assets (including servers, mainframes, etc.), ground support equipment (including tugs, tractors, fuel trucks and de-icers) and various other equipment. The remaining lease terms range from one month to five years. Certain leased assets are embedded within various ground and IT service agreements. For ground service contracts, we have elected to include both the lease and nonlease components in the lease asset and lease liability balances on our balance sheets. For IT service contracts, we have elected to separate the lease and nonlease components and only the lease components are included in the lease asset and lease liability balances on our balance sheets. The amounts of these lease and nonlease components are not significant.

The project cost approximately $2.5 billion. Asubstantial majority of the project costs were funded through the Regional Airports Improvement Corporation (""RAIC""), a California public benefit corporation, using a revolving credit facility provided by a group of lenders. The credit facility was executed in 2017 and we have guaranteed the obligations of the RAIC under the credit facility. Loans made under the credit facility are being repaid with the proceeds from the City of Los Angeles' (the ""City"") purchase of completed project assets. Under the lease agreement and subsequent project component approvals by the City's Board of Airport Commissioners, the City appropriated approximately $1.8 billion to purchase completed project assets, representing the maximum allowable reimbursement by the City. Costs incurred in excess of the $1.8 billion maximum were not reimbursed by the City. Our net project costs were approximately $700 million, of which approximately $350 million has been reflected as investing activities and approximately $350 million as operating activities in our cash flows statement since the project started in 2017. Based on our assessment of the project, we concluded that we do not control the underlying assets being constructed, and therefore, we do not have the project asset or related obligation recorded on our balance sheets, except for certain assets recorded as leasehold improvements within property and equipment, net on our balance sheets. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 75 --- PAGE 78 END --- Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements We have recorded approximately $350 million as a ROU asset on our balance sheets related to certain costs incurred in excess of RAIC funding, though we have not recognized a ROU asset and lease liability on our balance sheets for the variable lease payments in our agreement with the City. See Note 7, ""Leases"" for more information on our ROU assets and lease liabilities. New York-LaGuardia Airport In 2024, we substantially completed all construction for the replacement of Terminals C and D of the New York-LaGuardia Airport with a new state-of- the-art terminal facility. The project cost approximately $4.2 billion and was funded through debt issuance, existing cash and a Port Authority contribution of approximately $500 million. We entered into loan agreements to fund a portion of the construction, which are recorded on our balance sheets as debt with the proceeds reflected as restricted cash. Using funding primarily provided by these arrangements, we spent approximately $300 million, $500 million and $650 million during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Based on our assessment of the project, we concluded that we did not control the underlying assets being constructed.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS We sponsor defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, healthcare plans and disability and survivorship plans for eligible employees and retirees and their eligible family members. Defined Benefit Pension Plans. We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. These plans are generally closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals. Our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and any additional applicable legislation. Under current legislation, any required funding would be amortized over a rolling 15-year period and calculated using a discount rate of no less than 4.75% through 2030. We estimate that there will be approximately $80 million of minimum funding requirements under these plans in 2025. We also sponsor a market based cash balance defined benefit pension plan for eligible pilots that is funded by company contributions in excess of IRS limits in the 401(k) plan. We fund this plan with cash contributions as benefits are earned and invest those assets. The participants' benefit is the sum of the contributions made on their behalf plus any positive return on the invested contributions. In estimating the related benefit obligation and net benefit cost, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is used in determining the interest crediting rate. Defined Contribution Pension Plans. We sponsor several defined contribution plans. These plans generally cover different employee groups and employer contributions vary by plan. The costs associated with our defined contribution pension plans were approximately $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Postretirement Healthcare Plans. We sponsor healthcare plans that provide benefits to eligible retirees and their dependents who are under age 65. We have generally eliminated company-paid post age 65 healthcare coverage, except for (1) subsidies available to a limited group of retirees and their dependents, (2) a group of retirees who retired prior to 1987 and (3) retiree medical accounts which provide a fixed dollar amount to eligible employees who retired under the 2012 voluntary workforce reduction programs or the 2020 voluntary early retirement and separation programs (""voluntary programs""). Postemployment Plans. We provide certain other welfare benefits to eligible former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement, primarily as part of the disability and survivorship plans.

Expected Long-Term Rate of Return. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on plan-specific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data. Modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically. We also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets. We review our rate of return on plan assets assumptions annually. Our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. The investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to earn a long-term return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target while taking an acceptable level of risk and maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay current benefits and other cash obligations of the plan. This is achieved by investing in a globally diversified mix of public and private equity, fixed income, real assets, hedge funds and other assets and instruments. Our weighted average expected long-term rate of return on assets for net periodic cost/(benefit) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 6.97%. Life Expectancy. Changes in life expectancy may significantly impact our benefit obligations and future net periodic cost/(benefit). Each year we review information published by the Society of Actuaries and other publicly available information to develop our best estimate of life expectancy for purposes of measuring pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations.

These asset portfolios employ a diversified mix of investments, which are reviewed periodically. Active management strategies are utilized where feasible in an effort to realize investment returns in excess of market indices. Derivatives in the plans are primarily used to manage risk and gain asset class exposure while preserving liquidity. As part of these strategies, the plans are required to hold cash collateral associated with certain derivatives. Our investment strategies target a mix of 20-40% growth- seeking assets, 25-35% income-generating assets and 35-45% risk-diversifying assets. Risk diversifying assets include hedge funds implementing long- short, market neutral and relative value strategies that invest primarily in publicly-traded equity, fixed income, foreign currency and commodity securities and are used to improve the impact of active management on the plans.

Deliveries of these aircraft are scheduled to begin in 2026. Also during 2024 we amended our purchase agreement with Boeing and received an updated delivery schedule for our Boeing 737-10 orders. Contract Carrier Agreements We have contract carrier agreements with regional carriers expiring through 2034. These agreements are structured as either capacity purchase or revenue proration agreements. Capacity Purchase Agreements. Our contractual agreements with regional carriers are primarily capacity purchase arrangements, under which we control the scheduling, pricing, reservations, ticketing and seat inventories for the regional carriers' flights operating under our ""DL"" designator code. We are entitled to all ticket, cargo, mail, in-flight and ancillary revenues associated with the flights under these capacity purchase arrangements. We pay those airlines an amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services. The following table shows our minimum obligations at December 31, 2024 under our existing capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers, excluding contract carrier payments accounted for as leases of aircraft, which are described in Note 7, ""Leases."" The obligations set forth in the table contemplate minimum levels of flying by the regional carriers under the respective agreements and also reflect assumptions regarding certain costs associated with the minimum levels of flying such as the cost of fuel, labor, maintenance, insurance, catering, property tax and landing fees.

Although the outcome of the legal proceedings in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of current matters will not have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Credit Card Processing Agreements Our VISA/MasterCard and American Express credit card processing agreements provide that no cash reserve (""Reserve"") is required, and no withholding of payment related to receivables collected will occur, except in certain circumstances, including when we do not maintain a required level of liquidity as outlined in the merchant processing agreements. In circumstances in which the credit card processor can establish a Reserve or withhold payments, the amount of the Reserve or payments that may be withheld would be equal to the potential liability of the credit card processor for tickets purchased with VISA/MasterCard or American Express credit cards, as applicable, that had not yet been used for travel. We did not have a Reserve or an amount withheld as of December 31, 2024 or 2023. Other Contingencies General Indemnifications We are the lessee under many commercial real estate leases. It is common in these transactions for us, as the lessee, to agree to indemnify the lessor and the lessor's related parties for tort, environmental and other liabilities that arise out of or relate to our use or occupancy of the leased premises. This type of indemnity would typically make us responsible to indemnified parties for liabilities arising out of the conduct of, among others, contractors, licensees and invitees at, or in connection with, the use or occupancy of the leased premises. This indemnity often extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties, but usually excludes any liabilities caused by either their sole or gross negligence or their willful misconduct. Our aircraft and other equipment lease and financing agreements typically contain provisions requiring us, as the lessee or obligor, to indemnify the other parties to those agreements, including certain of those parties' related persons, against virtually any liabilities that might arise from the use or operation of the aircraft or other equipment. We believe that our insurance would cover most of our exposure to liabilities and related indemnities associated with the commercial real estate leases and aircraft and other equipment lease and financing agreements described above. While our insurance does not typically cover environmental liabilities, we have insurance policies in place as required by applicable environmental laws. Some of our aircraft and other financing transactions include provisions that require us to make payments to preserve an expected economic return to the lenders if that economic return is diminished due to specified changes in law or regulations. In some of these financing transactions, we also bear the risk of changes in tax laws that would subject payments to non-U.S. lenders to withholding taxes.

We periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets. We establish valuation allowances if it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize our deferred income tax assets. In making this determination, we consider available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, projected future taxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical financial results and tax planning strategies. At December 31, 2024 our net deferred tax liability balance was $2.1 billion, including a $951 million valuation allowance primarily related to certain net realized and unrealized capital losses and certain state net operating losses. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $2.7 billion of U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards which we are expecting to utilize during 2025. These net operating loss carryforwards were primarily generated in 2020 and do not expire. Therefore, we have not recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets other than the certain net realized and unrealized capital losses and certain state net operating losses that have short expiration periods.

EQUITY AND EQUITY COMPENSATION Equity We are authorized to issue 2.0 billion shares of capital stock, of which up to 1.5 billion may be shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and up to 500 million may be shares of preferred stock. Preferred Stock. We may issue preferred stock in one or more series. The Board of Directors is authorized (1) to fix the descriptions, powers (including voting powers), preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions with respect to any series of preferred stock and (2) to specify the number of shares of any series of preferred stock. We have not issued any preferred stock. Treasury Stock. We generally withhold shares of Delta common stock to cover employees' portion of required tax withholdings when employee equity awards vest. These shares are valued at cost, which equals the market price of the common stock on the date of vesting. The weighted average cost per share held in treasury was $31.06 and $30.37 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

During 2020 and 2021, in connection with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the ""CARES Act"") payroll support program (""PSP"") and extensions, we issued warrants to the U.S Department of the Treasury to acquire more than 11.1 million shares of Delta common stock, which have subsequently been sold to a third party. The number of warrants outstanding slightly increased and the exercise price of the warrants slightly decreased since December 31, 2023 due to adjustments resulting from dividend payments during 2024. Key terms under each program as of December 31, 2024 are as follows: Summary of payroll support program warrants Number of (in millions, except exercise price) Warrants Exercise Price _ Expiration Year Payroll Support Program (PSP1) 6.95 23.99 2025 Payroll Support Program Extension (PSP2) 2.4 39.11 2026 Payroll Support Program 3 (PSP3) 1.9 47.05 2026 Total 11.2 Equity Compensation Our broad-based equity and cash compensation plan provides for grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options, performance awards, including cash incentive awards and other equity-based awards (the ""Plan"").

The Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 163 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2024, there were nine million shares available for future grants. We make long-term incentive awards annually to eligible employees under the Plan. Generally, awards vest over time, subject to the employee's continued employment. Equity compensation expense, including awards payable in common stock or cash, is recognized in salaries and related costs over the employee's requisite service period (generally, the vesting period of the award) and totaled $236 million, $180 million and $150 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We record expense on a straight-line basis for awards with installment vesting. As of December 31, 2024, unrecognized costs related to unvested shares and stock options totaled $117 million. We expect substantially all unvested awards to vest and recognize forfeitures as they occur. Restricted Stock. Restricted stock is common stock that may not be sold or otherwise transferred for a period of time and is subject to forfeiture in certain circumstances. The fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the closing price of the common stock on the grant date. As of December 31, 2024, there were 4.3 million unvested restricted stock awards.

Potential performance award payments range from 0%-200% of a target level and are contingent upon our achieving certain financial and operational goals over a three-year performance period. Performance Restricted Stock Units (PRSU). Performance restricted stock units are long-term incentive opportunities that provide executive officers with the right to receive shares of Delta stock based on our achievement of certain performance conditions at the end of a three-year period. PRSUs were first granted to executive officers in 2022. Potential payouts range from 0%-300% of a target level for the grants in 2022 and 2023 and range from 0%-200% of a target level for the grants in 2024. Based on the closing stock price at year end and contingent on achieving the specified performance conditions, the maximum shares that could be issued were 6.0 million, 3.3 million and 1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 respectively.

Throughout the year, the DLC considers forecast to actual results and variances on a monthly and quarterly basis to allocate resources for the airline segment's fleet and network and to optimize the refinery segment's operations. The DLC also considers this information in strategic decisions related to capital allocations, including investments in fleet, ground, information technology and refinery assets, route and network development and human capital. Airline Segment Our airline segment is managed as a single business unit that provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the U.S. and around the world and includes our loyalty program, as well as other ancillary businesses. This allows us to benefit from an integrated revenue pricing and route network. Our flight equipment forms one fleet, which is deployed through a single route scheduling system. When making resource allocation decisions, our CODM evaluates aggregated flight profitability data, which considers fleet type and route economics, but gives no weight to the financial impact of the resource allocation decision on a geographic region or mainline/regional carrier basis. Our objective in making resource allocation decisions is to optimize our consolidated financial results. Refinery Segment Our Monroe subsidiary operates the Trainer oil refinery and related assets located near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as part of our strategy to mitigate the cost of the refining margin reflected in the price of jet fuel. Monroe's operations include pipelines and terminal assets that allow the refinery to supply jet ‘uel to our airline operations throughout the Northeastern U.S., including our New York hubs at LaGuardia and JFK. Our refinery segment operates for the benefit of the airline segment by providing jet fuel to the airline segment from its own production and through jet ‘uel obtained through agreements with third parties. The refinery's production consists of jet fuel, as well as non-jet fuel products. We exchange the non-jet ‘uel products produced by the refinery with counterparties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations. The gross fair value of the products exchanged under these agreements during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $1.5 billion, $2.4 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. Arefinery is subject to annual Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") requirements to blend renewable fuels into the gasoline and on-road diesel ‘uel it produces. A refinery may meet its obligation by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels, by purchasing Renewable Identification Numbers (""RINs"") in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing RINs. Because Monroe is able to blend only a small amount of renewable fuels, it must purchase the majority of its RINs requirement in the secondary market. Renewable fuel compliance costs are accrued in accounts payable each period as the RINs obligation is generated. Purchased RINs are carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value and are recorded in prepaid expenses and other. The RINs asset and obligation are retired when used to satisfy EPA requirements.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 11, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Atlanta, Georgia February 11, 2025 Delta Air Lines, Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K 93 --- PAGE 96 END --- ITEM 9B.

While some companies credit innovation or leadership for this kind of milestone, at Delta, it's because of our people, who are the Delta Difference, that we've made it this far and will continue soaring into the next century. The Delta Difference isn't new. For 100 years, Delta has been a company that puts people first - and that core value continues to shape how we care for employees, customers, communities and our planet. As we embark on our next 100 years, there's no question that the Delta Difference is alive and well across the globe, and it will fuel our insatiable desire to never stop climbing. This report is a celebration of that mindset that drives our people, who are the Delta Difference. People Community Environment Governance Appendix 4 FULL REPORT [2 A Message From Ed Bastian Delta is marking its centennial year in 2025 by Safety First celebrating our storied history while looking ahead to the next century of flight. Even 100 years ago, when Delta was a crop duster with a handful of planes and a passion for the skies, our founder imbued the company with a simple but powerful idea: Our success should be driven by our values of always putting people first. That's why, for the past century, we've run our business to serve our employees, customers, communities and owners in the best way possible. Long before annual reports like these became routine, we were measuring how well we were taking care of Delta's stakeholders. At the same time, we were learning from them, evolving and continually raising our bar as we grew into our global footprint. ""Keep Climbing"" isn't just a slogan - it's a way of life that dates to our earliest days. And today, it manifests itself in the Delta Difference that is powered by our people. Throughout Delta's history, our leadership has held fast to a simple philosophy we call the Virtuous Circle. When we take care of and invest in our people, they take care of our customers, who reward us with their business and loyalty. That, in turn, rewards our owners, who continue to trust the business with their capital, allowing further investment in Delta's people and customers. When it works, all stakeholders share in our success. The wisdom of that ideal continues to be",600

Throughout Delta's history, our leadership has held fast to a simple philosophy we call the Virtuous Circle. When we take care of and invest in our people, they take care of our customers, who reward us with their business and loyalty. That, in turn, rewards our owners, who continue to trust the business with their capital, allowing further investment in Delta's people and customers. When it works, all stakeholders share in our success. The wisdom of that ideal continues to be evident. In the past year, Delta's leadership was recognized with a No. 11 ranking on Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies list, awarded the most on-time North American airline by Cirium, named the Top U.S. Airline for the fourth year in a row by the Wall Street Journal and ranked by Fast Company in 2025 as one of the world's Most Innovative Companies and No.3 in the Corporate Social Responsibility category. Among all our priorities, the longest-standing mandate is safety, which harkens to the dawn of powered aviation. Safe and secure operations are our most fundamental obligation to customers, colleagues and the communities we serve, and our commitment to safety remains steadfast. Our safety expectations and standards are led by our code of ethics, titled The Way We Fly. And our teams continue to harness innovation and technology, including artificial intelligence (Al), to further elevate our safety-first culture. Commercial air travel remains, by far, the safest mode of transportation. That's been the case for decades, thanks to an industry-wide collaboration mandating that we always learn from any incident, large or small, that may affect safety. Air travel is a competitive industry, but we never compete on safety. Taking Care of People Our 100,000+ employees live by Delta's core values: Care, Integrity, Resilience, and Servant Leadership - they are the Delta Difference. We make strategic investments in our team and work to actively listen, encourage feedback and prioritize employee wellness to help our people thrive. And we always share our success, including $1.4 billion in employee profit sharing for 2024 (roughly 5 weeks' pay for each employee), $86 million in 2024 performance incentives to our people for meeting operational targets and 5% raises for our frontline workgroups in 2024. Serving Our Communities Supporting the communities where we live, work and serve has been a fundamental value for Delta for the past century. In 2016, we formalized that support with our commitment to dedicate 1% of our profits to our Ed [yf communities. In 2024, Delta provided nearly $65 million in charitable giving on behalf of Delta Air Lines and The Delta Air Lines Foundation via partnerships with local, national and global nonprofits and civic organizations. Supporting the Environment Increasing efficiency and reducing fuel burn is great for our business and our carbon footprint, and we've been on that journey for much of our history. Thanks to constant innovation in aerospace design, today's aircraft have more than twice the fuel efficiency of the earliest passenger jets. And we continue to transition Delta's fleet to more fuel-efficient planes, with 38 new next-generation aircraft delivered in 2024 that are 28% more efficient, on average, than aircraft retired since 2019. Delta also continues to invest in and support the use of sustainable aviation fuel through collaborative commitments and short- and long- term offtake agreements and partnerships. As we honor our 100 years of history, we're already planning our future. We remain steadfast in our belief that travel has the power to break down barriers, bridge divides",600

Taking care of people first means making sure they are safe. Safety, operational reliability and customer service have been Delta's foundation for 100 years. In 1928, our first logo said it plainly: speed, safety, comfort. That commitment to putting safety first, running the best operation in the industry and caring for our customers, collegues, service providers, and the communities we serve continues today. As part of our ""Safety First, Always"" policy, safe working conditions and behaviors are a nonnegotiable principle for all Delta people.

JOHN LAUGHTER Executive Vice President and Chief of Operations Governance Appendix 10 FULL REPORT [2 Safety Governance Delta's commitment to implementing strong safety governance is centralized around our Safety Management System (SMS) and company-wide Safety Policy. The Safety & Security Committee of Delta's Board of Directors meets at least five times per year to receive regular reports and updates on safety performance. The Committee oversees and consults with management regarding overall customer, employee and aircraft operating safety and security goals, performance and initiatives. Our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is he SMS Accountable Executive and therefore holds ultimate responsibility for the SMS and he company's overall safety performance. Our CEO and the Delta Leadership Committee continue to provide the necessary resources that our SMS requires to maintain safe operations. nternal safety roundtables, led by senior divisional eaders, are hosted on a quarterly basis to facilitate reviews of the overall health and effectiveness of Delta's SMS across multiple areas of the company. Within each operating division, a safety assurance group meets monthly to identify and tackle safety risks. Additionally, business unit heads meet weekly to review and discuss current safety-related activities and performance.

Delta is a signatory of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Safety Leadership Charter, which is designed to demonstrate commitment to cultivating a positive safety culture. Safety Leadership is an essential part of our SMS, and key to our success. Safety Leadership comprises a set of behaviors demonstrated by individual actions that drive our overall safety culture and are promoted company-wide. These include integrity, clear communication, accountability, listening and care. Through each and every employee embracing these characteristics, we continue to illustrate our commitment to the safety of our people and customers and to making safety our number one value. --- PAGE 10 END --- ADELTA Introduction Safety People Community Environment catety Leadersp ip Culture Safety Culture Delta's Code of Ethics and Business Conduct - titled The Way We Fly - reinforces our safety expectations and standards for employees and business partners around the world. We are committed to embodying the principles of Just Culture, in which employees and partners are empowered to report hazards and mistakes, leaders are accountable for responding in a fair manner, and we are all committed to continuous improvement and prioritizing learning from incidents. Our Safety Reporting Programs are a cornerstone of Delta's safety culture and SMS. These programs ensure all employees have an easy and effective way to share safety concerns and inadvertent deviations from policies and procedures. We maintain voluntary hazard reporting programs for all frontline employees that encourage the confidential disclosure of any potential incidents that may affect our overall safety performance. In 2024, nearly 89,000 frontline employees including pilots, flight attendants, dispatchers, load planners, schedulers, ground agents, maintenance personnel and engineers had direct access to voluntary hazard reporting. Delta is committed to a culture where employees may freely share safety concerns and inadvertent deviation from policies and procedures without fear of retaliation. We understand that people sometimes make mistakes while trying to do the right thing. Just Culture focuses on implementing essons learned rather than placing blame on individuals. In 2024, Delta employees reported 27,260 safety concerns internally, helping us to continue proactively managing risk. Proactive Safety Management As part of our SMS, Delta uses Safety Risk Management (SRM), a process through which we proactively identify potential operational hazards and put into place controls to mitigate risk. At Delta, we consider SRM an essential element of change management and it is routinely applied as changes occur around the airline, including: * Implementation of new systems, such as a new aircraft type Revision of existing systems, such as procedural or manual changes Development of new procedures, such as adding new airports to our network Identification of new hazards or ineffective risk controls through proactive analysis of our safety data Delta continues to explore and leverage new technology to enhance safety management.

Importantly, even with this application of Al, a human is always present in the safety system to assure the quality of reporting and analysis. Moving forward, the safety teams will train and evolve the Al capability to assist with how we analyze risk within and across operational divisions. --- PAGE 11 END --- Introduction ADELTA Safety Flight Safety Technology As part of our commitment to proactive safety management, we are sharing and communicating performance data with pilots as it relates to safety so they can make adjustments in real time. This includes continuing to expand the use of FlightPulse, a strategic impact app that transforms raw flight data into clear, actionable insights. FlightPulse enables pilots to analyze data associated with their flight plans to assess how they compare against standard operating practices, as well as other peers. FlightPulse can also be used in flight to observe any relevant top risks at any given location - including weather, historical trend data and regulatory considerations - and make necessary adjustments midflight. With a pilot interest rate of 95% across fleets, Delta pilots are using FlightPulse, a key tool for ensuring safe operations. Aircraft Deicing We also continue to enhance management of the key seasonal risk area of aircraft deicing. Prior to the upcoming season, we proactively review lessons learned from the previous season, update procedures and reinforce key concepts through training, including modern virtual reality training. Furthermore, we leverage robust assurance through employee reporting, routine audits during storms and continual proficiency checks of our deicing teams throughout the season. The data from these sources allows us to take a risk-based approach when analyzing performance and addressing issues. All of these items assure we proactively manage risk to assure safe operations. People Community Environment Delta's work environments at airport facilities and in aircraft cabins are subject to high temperatures seasonally at some of the airports we serve, particularly in the south and southwestern parts of the U.S. SMS provides the framework to proactively manage risks related to high temperatures. We use data from Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recordable injuries reporting, employee safety reports, equipment reliability reports and customer experience reports to understand our risk profile related to heat- related issues. These risks are continually analyzed and discussed on a weekly, monthly and quarterly basis by our safety and operations teams - and ultimately reviewed by our SMS Accountable Executive(s) with the Safety and Security Committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, heat-related risks occurring at airport locations where Delta utilizes third-party contractors is reviewed monthly and quarterly to ensure safety risks are regularly discussed and addressed with those providers. In 2024, Delta had five recordable heat-related injuries or illnesses.

AIRPORT RAMP ENVIRONMENT We maintain Heat Injury/IIlness Prevention Plans locally to minimize heat risk in our ground operations (or ramp) environment. These plans are maintained by Delta and our contractors and all plans must include the following elements: 1. Access to water 2. Access to shade 3. Emergency procedures 4. Training on the plan for all employees Additional procedures may include safety alerts, leadership check-ins with employees and working with a buddy to watch Governance Appendix 12 FULL REPORT |2 over each other during periods of high temperatures. The plans are updated annually by local and corporate leaders and checked by safety compliance auditors no less than once every 24 months. While we make our best effort to execute a strong, comprehensive plan, we also recognize that the policies and procedures may not cover all situations in our dynamic environment. Therefore, our culture is one of empowerment, where any employee or contractor may call a ""Safety Time Out"" to pause to correct a safety issue, including heat-related issues, and they will be fully supported by senior leaders. Furthermore, we are proud to be in our third year of partnership with the Korey Stringer Institute, guiding Delta in our efforts to proactively address the risk of heat-related injuries/illnesses, which includes evaluation of uniforms, new training and town halls across the Delta system. AIRCRAFT CABINS High temperatures, maintenance challenges or other factors sometimes lead to elevated temperatures in airplane cabins, especially during ground operations. In extreme cases, passengers, flight and cabin crew, and ground team members servicing aircraft can experience conditions that present personal safety and health risks. We are upgrading air conditioning units across the system, and we have developed proactive weather alerting that identifies airports and flights with increased risk of a hot-cabin incident. These alerts allow for timely preparation - not only of our equipment to support customers on board, but also for our employees and our contractors who are exposed to the effects of higher outside air temperatures, to have the necessary means to avoid or manage hot-cabin events. In 2024, Delta invested $4 million in air conditioning units at stations with the highest risk of hot cabins. Looking forward, we plan to continue investing to lower the overall age of equipment. --- PAGE 12 END --- ADELTA Introduction Safety People Community Environment Employee Safety Programs and Training Delta is committed to ensuring that all our employees and partners have a safe work environment.

We focus on providing the policies, procedures and education that are essential to keeping our people and customers safe. Safety Culture and Safety Time Outs As part of our Safety Culture, we empower our employees and business partners to slow down or stop any operation if they feel it is necessary to do so for safety reasons. This includes promoting the use of Safety Time Outs, which are employee-initiated pauses to address safety concerns.

Annual Safety Summit In 2024, we held our third annual Safety & Environmental Summit, where more than 400 participants, including our Chief of Operations, a member of our Board of Directors and several Delta senior leaders, gathered to discuss safety and environmental best practices. The focus of the summit was the importance of teamwork to achieve operational excellence. The summit brought safety, environmental and operations leaders and professionals together to focus on subjects such as safety culture, investigation techniques, regulatory compliance, environmental risk management, proper handling of dangerous goods, spill prevention, occupational injury prevention and aircraft damage prevention. Safety Training and Initiatives Delta provides employees with comprehensive safety training, which covers subjects such as regulatory compliance, workplace hazards, safety behaviors and personal protective equipment. To supplement training and embed a culture of safety throughout Delta, we regularly communicate the importance of safety through weekly videos, internal posts, town halls and daily interactions with leaders and within workspaces. Additionally, in 2024 Delta continued to make major investments in safety-related infrastructure as well as safety equipment upgrades, such as collision avoidance systems for ground support vehicles, power stows for efficient aircraft loading and air conditioning units to keep aircraft cool for Delta ground teams. The safety leadership expectations that we set for all our employees also extend to Delta's contractors, vendors and business partners. As a result, we enable a safe working environment across the company and work to maintain and continually improve our overall safety performance year over year, including an 11% reduction in total recordable incident rates since 2023.

Our people are Delta's most important asset, and we work to ensure their utmost safety at all times. However, despite our thorough safety prevention measures, accidents may still happen.

Immediately following the accident, Delta took steps to make available a special contingent of health care professionals as part of our Employee Assistance Program, to ensure the mental health and well-being of anyone affected. Delta Corporate Safety led an internal investigation that resulted in existing safety protocols being reinforced and additional procedural measures being put in place to further ensure tire deflation prior to disassembly. Delta also fully cooperated with the investigations carried out by the FAA and OSHA. Safety Assessments and Audits Through Delta's Internal Evaluation Program, we routinely conduct assessments to evaluate the effectiveness of key operational programs across the airline and their compliance with Delta protocols. Process assessments such as these play a critical role in ensuring the health and effectiveness of our operational and safety policies and procedures. We also conduct regular quality assurance audits across domestic and international locations to monitor all Delta ground and maintenance operations. All audit results are transferred into Delta's overarching SMS and made available for review by senior leadership on a monthly basis. To complement our internal safety assessments and audits, Delta also receives independent, third- party safety audits carried out by the FAA, IATA's Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) Program and the U.S. Department of Defense. In 2024, Delta successfully completed the revised Risk-Based IOSA, focusing on key standards across operating divisions and demonstrating our high performance and dedication to our most important behavior - Safety First, Always.

We recently adopted a more holistic approach to employee listening in line with the level of sophistication Delta employs in listening to our customers. In 2024, we conducted a Total Rewards Survey to gather feedback on the total package of compensation and benefits our people receive, also known as Total Rewards. We collected 35,000 responses, with participants ranking employee travel benefits as the No. 1 reason they want to work at Delta. Based on the survey feedback, we introduced several pass travel changes for 2025 aimed at providing greater flexibility and opportunities for employees' family and friends to travel. Also in 2024, we saw record participation in our Employee Engagement Survey, with over 42,000 employees participating and sharing almost 68,000 comments. Survey feedback that financial health remained top of mind for employees influenced Delta's decision to extend our Emergency Savings Program beyond 2025, when it had been set to expire. In addition, the 2024 Employee Engagement Survey included a new Purpose category. Governance Appendix 18 FULL REPORT [2 Work anniversaries are so important at Delta that we even put our own spin on the name: Deltaversary, a day to celebrate and check in on each employee. In 2024, we expanded the Deltaversary Survey to include all corporate (salaried merit) employees, in addition to frontline employees. Delta uses employee feedback to inform investments in our people and provide senior leaders with actionable insights concerning programs and policies. Leaders receive aggregated results for their teams, with Employee Engagement Survey responses remaining confidential.

INSPIRING FUTURE AVIATORS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS Each year, Delta invites students from underrepresented groups to come fly with crews in whom they can see themselves. In celebration of Girls in Aviation Day, we partnered with Women in Aviation International to host our eighth Aviation Women Inspiring the Next Generation Flight. A flight piloted, staffed and crewed entirely by women brought 136 girls ages 11-18 from Atlanta to NASA's Kennedy Space Center to introduce them to careers in aviation and engage directly with women in these roles. Another program, DREAM Flight, is a special charter flight featuring an all-Black crew that carries Black students from Atlanta to an aviation-themed destination each year in partnership with the Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals (OBAP). We commemorated our 24th annual DREAM Flight with Delta First Officer Kyle Foley as pilot - revisiting his experience as a 12-year-old passenger on our first-ever DREAM Flight in 2000. Delta's partnership with OBAP has given 21 Black students opportunities to better understand pathways to aviation careers.

Our philosophy is to provide industry-leading total rewards for industry-leading performance. BASE PAY Our goal is for our people, regardless of their roles, to build a long-term career with Delta. In 2025, we announced a 4% base pay increase for ground employees and flight attendants, along with a 4% pool for merit! employees, which will take effect in June 2025.

For merit employees, we consider individual performance, market competitiveness and internal equity when determining base pay. For the past three People Environment Community years, we have increased the merit budget to match the general increase in pay scales for frontline employees. ANNUAL PROFIT SHARING Delta's industry-leading Profit Sharing Program recognizes every employee's contribution to meeting our financial target. No other airline shares more of its profits with employees. We calculate annual profit-sharing payouts based on our Profit Sharing Plan formula. Each year Delta earns a profit, we pay eligible employees worldwide 10% of adjusted profits up to $2.5 billion, and 20% of adjusted profits over $2.5 billion. Payments are awarded on February 14, our annual Profit Sharing Day. For 2024, Delta paid out $1.4 billion in profit sharing. It was the eighth year Delta has shared more than $1 billion in profits.

Additionally, Delta provides basic life insurance to all domestic employees (other than officers), as well as access to other voluntary benefits at group rates. Union Representation and Collective Bargaining Delta is known for its culture centered on taking care of our people so that they can take care of our customers. We support our people throughout their career. That means respecting all employees' legal rights, including the right to collective bargaining. Our U.S.-based employees are covered by the Railway Labor Act (RLA), the federal law governing labor relations between air carriers and their employees. Under the RLA, employees have the right to decide whether they wish to be represented by a union or to reject union representation. Because this is an important decision, it is necessary that Delta people have accurate information when making it, which is why, in compliance with the law, Delta shares facts about union representation and the impact it could have on how we work together. Delta also has written policies that support our people's right to advocate for or against union representation: * Solicitation and advocacy activities by Delta people on Delta premises are permitted.

To explore and support the most promising advancements, Delta continually seeks to partner with researchers and disruptive innovators working at the leading edge of sustainable aviation. Delta has partnered with Airbus on the ZEROe project, which aims to develop the first hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft for market entry. In 2024, Delta worked with Airbus, Plug Power and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) to explore the potential for implementing hydrogen as an alternative fuel source for future aircraft and ground equipment operations. As one of the world's busiest airports, ATL offers a unique opportunity for Delta and its partners to better understand airport requirements and fleet expectations for the use of hydrogen fuel within an operational environment. With the study scheduled for completion by 2026, we hope to use the lessons learned to help facilitate the future use of green hydrogen at ATL and across the Delta network. n 2024, Boeing continued progress toward building the X-66 demonstrator for its transonic truss-braced wing design. Work included the removal of engines from Delta-provided M90 aircraft, performing computational analysis of wing/truss structural and aero design, and performing extensive wind tunnel testing. Delta is working to bring to market an all-electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxi home-to-seat (airport) service with our partners at Joby Aviation. As part of the first-of-its-kind arrangement, both companies will work together to integrate Joby-operated eVTOL service into Delta's existing hub airports in New York and Los Angeles. This will further elevate and differentiate the Delta travel experience in these strategic markets with home-to-airport transportation for customers, providing an opportunity to reserve seats for short-range zero- operating-emissions journeys to and from city airports.

Delta's Carbon Council, a cross-divisional group of senior leaders, is responsible for leading this work and driving reductions in fuel consumption in line with our near-, medium- and long-term goals. In 2024, Delta implemented three operational changes to increase fuel savings. We adopted a new engine wash program at five of our domestic service hubs and across eight engine fleets. The new wash solutions, developed by AeroCore, increases engine performance and reduces fuel consumption by using patented foam injection technology to remove harmful deposits and contaminants. We also collaborated with Boeing to certify a new low-flaps landing procedure across our 717 fleet. Finally, Delta has adopted GE Fuel Insight, an application that combines full-flight aircraft data with flight plan and fuel information to enhance the identification of fuel-savings opportunities. --- PAGE 41 END --- Introduction Safety ADELTA The Carbon Council also oversees efforts to reduce fuel use by optimizing aircraft weight. In 2022, Delta piloted a program utilizing automated data collection and artificial intelligence to track demand for different types of soda on board. Initially tested at a single hub, the detailed data from this study provided insight on which sodas were consumed in flight. With this information, we reduced the amount of certain types of sodas loaded on the plane, helping to reduce weight and fuel consumption, as well as associated costs. In 2024, we scaled the program to six of our hub airports with the goal of gaining more comprehensive insight and reducing service weight across a greater number of flights. Together, these and other initiatives helped increase total operational fuel savings by 23 million gallons in 2024, for a total of 44 million gallons saved in 2024 and contributing to our goal of 11 billion gallons of cumulative fuel savings by 2035, compared to a 2019 baseline. Delta continues to leverage a series of operational fuel key performance indicators (KPIs) to help reduce our fuel consumption and associated GHG emissions. These include metrics such as average auxiliary power unit (APU) runtime minutes, service weight per available seat mile and excess endurance fuel carried. Roughly 65% of all frontline employees' work is assigned to a fuel KPI to help consolidate our fuel-efficiency efforts across the organization. Environment RS —h People Community USING LESS JET FUEL ON THE GROUND Another way to drive fuel savings is by limiting the use of APUs during ground operations. We continue to work with airport partners to increase the installation of ground power units and preconditioned air (PCA) units at several of our hubs.

Environment Governance FULL REPORT |2 Appendix 44 People Community MY Working Together With Americans SAF Market Engagement and Advocacy Jou for Clean Aviation Fuels As part of our commitment to transparent climate policy leadership, we engage in state, federal and international SAF policy advocacy to help implement initiatives that accelerate SAF development. Within the U.S., Delta has advocated for the bipartisan federal support for the SAF market and proposed new SAF tax incentives within our hub states of Michigan, New York and Massachusetts. At an international level, Delta is engaged in partnerships with various trade associations to scale the global SAF market and enable us to reach our net-zero goal by 2050. To learn more about our SAF advocacy, which underpins our business ; and climate objectives, please see our Climate Lobbying section. Scaling SAF Production and Development Since 2023, Delta has taken part in Americans for Clean Aviation Fuels, the first national collaboration of the largest economic actors in the U.S. economy - from farmers to fuel producers and aviation to agribusiness - to promote the economic benefits of clean aviation fuels. By promoting the benefits of a robust market for SAF and sustainable alternatives to conventional jet fuel, Delta is helping to drive a national effort to advance policies that power economic and energy security for future generations. For more information, see our Climate Lobbying Report. Delta continues to support and expand important partnerships and coalitions across industries to help scale the SAF market. In 2023, we introduced the Minnesota SAF Hub, a first- of-its-kind coalition leveraging collaboration across the value chain to scale SAF at MSP and support economic development in the state.

To date, we have successfully implemented several initiatives, including replacing plastic cutlery with bamboo alternatives and transitioning to dishware made from biodegradable materials. For several years, we have been working to address one of our most significant waste streams: SUP cups. In late 2024, we began the rollout of Delta's new paper cup on international flights, with plans to expand to domestic flights. This cup is the culmination of several years of testing and a full- scale life-cycle analysis and meets both Delta's high standards for performance and stringent regulations across multiple international jurisdictions. The new design can handle a wide variety of beverages and will take the place of two different types of cups, helping to reduce plastic waste, saving space on board and streamlining stocking procedures. When fully rolled out, we estimate the new cup will eliminate nearly 7 million pounds of SUP annually! Delta has also reduced SUPs from other sources within our onboard services, including earbuds and beverages. In 2024, we removed 170,000 pounds of SUPs from our earbud products and packaging.

Delta believes climate policy for the aviation industry should also be: * Sector-specific but augmented by complementary policies to support our broader sustainability strategy (e.g., electrification of GSE and operations) * Preventative of revenue diversion for non- aviation climate mitigation purposes, ensuring we reinvest any revenue generated into this hard-to-abate sector and the diverse workforce it supports Governance Appendix 49 FULL REPORT [2 Grounded in science to ensure GHG emissions reductions are maximized and realized in a manner designed to minimize increased costs for travelers Performance-based, feedstock-neutral and technology-neutral, recognizing the innovations needed to decarbonize our sector are not yet commercially available at scale Supportive of the long-term capital investment necessary to sustain multidecade aviation infrastructure and equipment commitments Rooted in the need for operational safety, technological feasibility and economic reasonableness Designed to drive efficiency in fleet procurement, fuel burn and air traffic operations Designed to incentivize rather than mandate a zero-carbon trajectory at the lowest cost (e.g., tax incentives, grants, research and development investment, voluntary opt-in), as there is no scalable market where SAF can compete ona level playing field with the on-road fuels market --- PAGE 49 END --- ADELTA Introduction Safety S Governance 5] 53 53 54 54 Board-Level Oversight Political Activity and Policy Engagement Business Ethics Data Privacy and Information Security Responsible Approach to Al --- PAGE 50 END --- DELTA Board-Level Oversight At the core of Delta's governance structure is the history of a strong, independent Board of Directors composed of experienced members with diverse backgrounds, qualifications, skills and experiences. The Board is committed to sound corporate governance in line with evolving best practices. Our governance structure and practices are described in detail in our Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Oversight of Environmental, Social and Governance Matters The Board of Directors understands, and is committed to, the importance of environmental, social and governance matters and their significance to our stakeholders. The Board includes several directors with skills and experience directly relevant to these topics, which ensures a broad perspective in evaluating environmental, social and governance matters. In addition, the Board has and continues to gain knowledge about evolving areas through, among other things, regular briefings and discussions with internal subject-matter experts. The Board also has access to external resources and education on a variety of matters. Introduction Safety People Community Environment OVERSIGHT OF RISK The Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility to oversee Delta's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, including with respect to environmental, social and governance matters. The ERM program's primary objectives include facilitating a cross-functional enterprise-wide risk assessment, integrating the ERM framework into business processes and decision-making, holding management accountable to mitigate risks and providing assurance that the risk-governance systems are functioning appropriately. The Board discusses risk throughout the year, particularly when reviewing operating and strategic plans and when considering specific actions for approval.

These councils meet regularly to drive these efforts in coordination with cross- functional working groups across the company. The DLC is regularly briefed on various environmental, social and governance matters by our EVP - Chief External Affairs Officer and frequently engages with internal subject-matter experts on these topics. Over the course of 2024, the DLC was briefed on Delta's long-term climate strategy by our Chief Sustainability Officer. This brief included the comprehensive strategy that set the foundation for our short-, medium- and long-term milestones and targets, which will drive our path to net-zero emissions by 2050, and progress against that strategy. The strategy review also included potential risks and opportunities specific to our sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) strategy, which is core to Delta's decarbonization efforts.
