      " Delta's DEI strategy is focused on three main areas: valuing diversity, pursuing equity, and promoting inclusion. The company aims to create a work environment where all employees feel valued, respected, and empowered to contribute their best work (chunk_128). Delta's approach to DEI includes initiatives such as expanding recruitment efforts, seeking qualified interview panelists from diverse backgrounds, and promoting leadership development programs to reflect the diversity of its workforce (chunk_128). The company also strives to create merit-based access to career opportunities by considering skills as equivalencies to education (chunk_128). Additionally, Delta partners with organizations to support underrepresented groups, such as the Partnership for Your Success program with the U.S. Army, to connect enlisting soldiers and Reserve Officers' Training Corps cadets to interviews and potential full-time jobs following their military service (chunk_128). Overall, Delta's DEI strategy is designed to foster a culture of inclusion, respect, and opportunity for all employees, regardless of their background or experiences (chunk_128).\n",
