Together, these and other initiatives helped increase total operational fuel savings by 23 million gallons in 2024, for a total of 44 million gallons saved in 2024 and contributing to our goal of  11 billion gallons of cumulative fuel savings  by 2035, compared to a 2019 baseline.

Taking Care of People  Our 100,000+ employees live by Delta's core values: Care, Integrity, Resilience, and Servant Leadership - they are the Delta Difference. We make strategic investments in our team and work to actively listen, encourage feedback and prioritize employee wellness to help our people thrive. And we always share our success, including $1.4 billion in employee profit sharing for 2024 (roughly 5 weeks' pay for each employee), $86 million in 2024 performance incentives to our people for meeting operational targets and  5% raises for our frontline workgroups in 2024.

In 2016, we formalized that support with our commitment to dedicate 1% of our profits to our  Ed [yf  communities. In 2024, Delta provided nearly $65 million in charitable giving on behalf of Delta Air Lines and The Delta Air Lines Foundation via partnerships with local, national and global nonprofits and civic organizations.  Supporting the Environment  Increasing efficiency and reducing fuel burn is great for our business and our carbon footprint, and we've been on that journey for much of our history. Thanks to constant innovation in aerospace design, today's aircraft have more than twice the fuel efficiency of the earliest passenger jets. And we continue to transition Delta's fleet to more fuel-efficient planes, with 38 new next-generation aircraft delivered in 2024 that are 28% more efficient, on average, than aircraft retired since 2019. Delta also continues to invest in and support the use of sustainable aviation fuel through collaborative commitments and short- and long- term offtake agreements and partnerships.
